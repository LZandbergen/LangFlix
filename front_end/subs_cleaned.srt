00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Wait, why do you spend so much time
with my brother if not to see me?

290
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,240
He's been my best friend for 20 years.

292
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm not gonna stop seeing him
because we had a thing.

294
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
A thing? I mean...

296
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,040
- For eight years...
- You're completely insane!

299
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,040
I see you prowling around my place.

301
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,640
I can't sleep. I'm always scared,
you appear out of nowhere.

303
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,400
What's next, huh?
You break into my house, kidnap me?

305
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
You make it sound
like I'm fit to be locked up.

307
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
- [Léa chuckles]
- [Guillaume] Yes, that's why I'm here.

309
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
Even when we were together,

311
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,160
you spent all your time
posting our life on social media.

313
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
I can't take it anymore.

314
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
I'm done with you harassing me. I'm...

316
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
It's over, Léa.

319
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
And I blocked
all your shitty fake profiles.

320
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,880
Jack-the-doggy, Nighttime surfing,
Cyril Coaching too.

323
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
Cyril Coaching, that's not even me.

325
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,000
MANON CAPRIANI AND HER FAKE ASS CRASH!

326
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,400
EVEN HER FAKE ASS
COULDN'T STAND HER LAME SONGS

327
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,280
VIEWS, COMMENTS

JUMP!

330
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Aw, I want to die.

333
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,360
- Oh, stop it, Manon.
- [Manon] Ooh, what a disaster!

335
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,680
I'll never get married.

337
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,600
That's for sure. It's all over for me.

339
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
- Come on, cousin. Look at me.
- I'm screwed. Yeah, why not.

342
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,000
- Are you nobodies or not nobodies?
- Yes. We are nobodies.

344
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,480
- Louder.
- We are nobodies.

346
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
There you go!

348
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Aah!

349
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,000
[snaps]
Mm. Bernie!

351
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,160
Keep the shots coming,
we're gonna get wasted.

Oh, no!

MOM
INCOMING CALL

364
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,600
No!

365
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,400
SORRY, MY BUGS BUNNY SUCKED

367
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
Whoa. Oh, no!

[both laughing]

380
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,160
I think we need to put a lot on
because it needs to... really take.

383
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,280
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Let's put some more. Come on.

385
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,120
That's the best idea
I've ever had in my entire life.

387
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Do you trust me or not?
Am I your cousin or not?

389
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,216
- Does it hurt when I pull it?
- [Manon] No, you're hurting me.

391
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
[chuckles] I'm doing it
just like in those American movies.

394
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,040
Yup. You'll see you're going to be

396
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
- incognito. You look great.
- Ah!

398
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,960
- Nobody will recognize you.
- But, nobody ever?

400
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Nobody ever.

402
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,040
<i>Baby, I know you're not answering
cause you're embarrassed.</i>

<i>I told you this whole thing
would end badly.</i>

405
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,560
Tell me when you wanna come home
to Corsica. I'll buy your ticket.

407
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
- <i>It makes me happy. Okay?</i>
- Oh, God.

409
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,880
- Oh, I can't stand it anymore.
- Okay. Bye, Patoche.

411
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,680
- She's so exhausting. She tires me.
- Ooh, get out.

414
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Whoa, it's mom, I live in Corsica.
[jabbering]

415
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Ugh! Stay away.

417
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,136
- Say hi to Patoche.
- Stay over there.

419
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
- No more Patoche.
- [grunts]

421

- [chuckling]
- Do it again.

422
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,280
- It's Mom. No more Mom.
- Ugh! Oh, yeah.

424
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
- You shouldn't...
- Mother. No more mother.

426
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840

- No problem.

- Ugh, Driko!
- No more Driko.

431
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,520
Why do I push myself to keep this thing
in front of my face like this?

433
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
Seriously.
Why don't we leave it in a small box?

435
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,800
Mm-hm, with miniature key.

437

It's done! No more problems!

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,560
And no more Guillaume!

450

- Thanks. It was your idea!
- Do you have a clock in here?

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
Oh, fuck! I'm gonna be late for work!

It's 7:48 p.m., we slept all day.

500
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,320
No, it isn't! Calm down.
We never set the time on the oven.

501
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, yeah! I need to get that fixed.

504
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,976
- What, the oven?
- No, my <font color=#00D1FF weight=750><b>phone</b></font>.

506
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800

- What? What?

507
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,720
- What?
- One second, I'm thinking.

509
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,960
Stop thinking. We're clearly total morons.
That's messed up, what we did.

511
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm not so sure. Maybe not.

513
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Maybe it was actually a genius idea.

[chuckles]
You're still drunk.

518
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Look at us. Don't you want to start over?

519
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,720
With a clean slate, huh!
Reclaim our fucking dignity!

521
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

523
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,080
See, yes! We're onto something!
I swear we're on the right track.

526
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,800
Actually, we need to do uh,
a sort of uh... cure.

528
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,760
Yeah, a cure. You know, like when um...

530
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,360
Like purifying your body,
you know, and mind.

532
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,576
- Like some people do.
- Who are these people, you say?

534
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,760
- Léa.
- Yes?

536
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,096
You can't live your life like this, Léa,

537
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,480
with the sword of Heracles
hanging over your head.

539
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
It's Damocles, Manon.

541
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
- But it's fine.
- It's Damocles?

543
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
- Yeah, it's Damocles.
- I'm an idiot.

545
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,120
I spent my life on the Internet

547
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,280
watching stupid videos when I should
read books. You know, I'm uncultured!

549
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
No, you're not.

551
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,280
A little, sure. No!

552
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
Who cares, you've got other qualities.
Okay, anyway, I don't see the connection

554
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,640
- with, this sudden idea of doing a detox.
- Detox!

556
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,520
- That's the word!
- No!

558
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,256
- That's what we need to do, Léa.
- No. Still, no.

560
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
- Yes.
- No.

562
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Okay.

563
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,480
What if it helps you with Guillaume?

565
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm listening.

567
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,400
- If you're off the grid, no more stalking.
- Mm. Yeah.

570
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
- You leave him alone.
- Mm-hm.

572
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,400
Well then maybe Guillaume
will agree to withdraw his complaint.

573
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
Interesting.

575
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,000
You could start over. Right?
You'd be free.

577
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,960
I would. With wonderful goals.

579
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,520
We need to do this detox.

581
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,280
- We're gonna do it.
- Of course.

583
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,280
You know why? Because I'm tired
of people telling me what to do.

585
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,840
What to say, what to eat,
what to think, what to sing.

588
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
Guillaume withdrew his complaint.
Hold on. Hold on.

590
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
- That would mean he regrets.
- Maybe!

591
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
- Definitely.
- And actually, I'm tired.

594
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,736
- Of wearing those tiny dresses...
- Of course, yeah.

595
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,136
...squeeze like a tight hog.
It doesn't suit me at all. Right?

597
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Oh, Guillaume. He'll invite me
to our favorite restaurant.

599
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,120
The small Japanese joint in Belleville.

601
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
We'll toast with two glasses of Rosé.

603
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,320
And he'll look at me in the eyes saying,

605
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,080
that he still loves me,
that we can start again.

607
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,960
And I'll tell him
that I still love him too.

609
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
It's going to be crazy, you know.
We'll laugh and we'll cry.

612
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,920
[gasping]

613
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,536
We'll be in love
for the rest of our lives.

615
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,400
[gasps]
It's great.

617
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
I'll get back with my ex.

619
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,920
Okay, I'm with you on this detox!

622

[Gagan laughing]

624
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,920
No. No way you can pull this off, girls.
And for a whole month?

627
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,120
Yeah, just like Dry January.
It doesn't end on the 15th, does it?

630
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,656
Or try Smokeout,
without smoking for a month.

632
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,576
- It's always a month.
- The Summer Body challenge.

633
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,680
- [Léa] Exactly.
- I got it.

635
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,440
[chuckles]
It makes sense.

636
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,376
So, you want me
to look after your stuff, right?

638
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,560
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's fine.

640
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,040
I'm... I'm looking forward to it.

Okay. Give me your arm, please.

Don't worry.

647

Here.

649
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,000
That's... the shop's phone number
so people can reach you.

652
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,840
Yeah, exactly. And you,
you can use my phone here.

654
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,000
- Aah.
- Aah.

656
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh, yeah. What a nice guy,
quick thinking, smart guy.

657
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,216
What do you want me to say?
Don't you agree with me.

659
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,920
Yes? Now, get lost.
I have a Tinder date in five minutes.

664
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Léa, you do know that us grown-ups
don't only have sex at night,

667
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
right, don't you?

669
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,160
No, I know... that.

671
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,400
It's just that it's been a while
since I've done it in the daytime.

673
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,840
- All right.
- Right.

- Thanks.
- Thank you.

Are we whispering on account of Pablo
or because of my selfish brother?

He was on night shift for 48 hours
and since his Ph.D. is coming...

1003
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,296
Of course he prefers sleeping
on the couch,

1004
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,616
that way he can easily annoy you.

1005

- All right, let's go.
- He pisses me off.

- Thanks for your help.
- No worries.

No, don't bother. Keep it. All good.

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,600
Yeah. Same for sure. I guess it's true,
the thing about blue light.

1177
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
- Yes. Of course.
- Mm-hm. Don't I look better?

1179
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
- I've never seen you look so good.
- Really? Yeah.

1181
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,880
- You too.
- [Manon] Thanks.

1182
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
[Audrey] Hi!

1184
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,600
What the hell? Now they'll never
warn us before they visit.

1186
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
This is an emergency,
so be happy I have your keys.

1188
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,480
I have two bad news, one for each of you.

1190
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,600
- Who should I start with?
- [phone vibrates, pings]

1192
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
[smacks lips]

1193
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
[sighs]

1194
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,920
Manon, your mom is coming this weekend.

1196
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,840
Impossible. She'd never close
her restaurant for the weekend.

1198
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes. She called,
she's coming for Julien's Ph.D.

1200
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,360
[scoffs]

1202
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,120
What are you talking about?
She doesn't give a shit at...

1205
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,680
[gasping]
Oh, my God! She's coming for me.

1207
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,376
Actually, you're like
a giant notification,

1209
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,920
you pop up without warning
even when no one asked you a thing.###one:une:7.0###

1210
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,920
- [chuckles]
- I'm glad you find it funny,

1212
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
'cause the next one won't be
and it's for you.

1214
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,040
It's popping up without warning.
It's about Julien's Ph.D. presentation.

1215
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,320
[inhales, exhales]
Guillaume's coming.

1217
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,040
With a plus one.

1219
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,040
With a plus one?
[chuckles]

1221
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,080
What does that mean? Who?
Who's the plus one?

1223
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,440
Who else could it be, if not me?
I don't understand.

1225
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,640
Who is it? It's a girl?
[nervous chuckle]

1227
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
[chuckling]
Which girl?

1229
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
[panting]

1231
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,480
Okay, who is it, who is it?
I don't understand.

1233
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,000
Who? Tell me.
It must be a really good friend.

1234
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,520
No, wait, is it a cat?

1236
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,920
It's an animal? It's a pussy cat.
Shit, it's a pussy!

1239
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,680
Whose pussy is it? Who is it?
Tell me who the fucking plus one is!

1240
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,016
- [Manon] No! No! No!
- [Léa] No!

1242
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,216
- Léa! Calm down.
- [Léa] Give it to me.

1243
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
[Manon] Stop, Léa! Take it!

1245
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,016
- [Léa] Give it to me!
- [Audrey] I don't have it.

1248
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,136
- [Manon] Stop it!
- [Léa] Where is it?

1249
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,200
[all] No!

1251
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
[cracks]

1253
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,040
[closing theme music playing]
