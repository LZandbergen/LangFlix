Wait, why do you spend so much time
with my brother if not to see me?

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,240
He's been my best friend for 20 years.

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm not gonna stop seeing him
because we had a thing.

158
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
A thing? I mean...

159
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,040
- For eight years...
- You're completely insane!

160
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,040
I see you prowling around my place.

161
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,640
I can't sleep. I'm always scared,
you appear out of nowhere.

162
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,400
What's next, huh?
You break into my house, kidnap me?

163
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
You make it sound
like I'm fit to be locked up.

164
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
- [Léa chuckles]
- [Guillaume] Yes, that's why I'm here.

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
Even when we were together,

166
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,160
you spent all your time
posting our life on social media.

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
I can't take it anymore.

168
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
I'm done with you harassing me. I'm...

169
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
It's over, Léa.

170
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
And I blocked
all your shitty fake profiles.

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,880
Jack-the-doggy, Nighttime surfing,
Cyril Coaching too.

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
Cyril Coaching, that's not even me.

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,000
MANON CAPRIANI AND HER FAKE ASS CRASH!

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,400
EVEN HER FAKE ASS
COULDN'T STAND HER LAME SONGS

175
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,280
VIEWS, COMMENTS

176

JUMP!

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Aw, I want to die.

178
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,360
- Oh, stop it, Manon.
- [Manon] Ooh, what a disaster!

179
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,680
I'll never get married.

180
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,600
That's for sure. It's all over for me.

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
- Come on, cousin. Look at me.
- I'm screwed. Yeah, why not.

182
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,000
- Are you nobodies or not nobodies?
- Yes. We are nobodies.

183
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,480
- Louder.
- We are nobodies.

184
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
There you go!

185
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Aah!

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,000
[snaps]
Mm. Bernie!

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,160
Keep the shots coming,
we're gonna get wasted.

Oh, no!

MOM
INCOMING CALL

195
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,600
No!

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,400
SORRY, MY BUGS BUNNY SUCKED

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
Whoa. Oh, no!

[both laughing]

205
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,160
I think we need to put a lot on
because it needs to... really take.

206
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,280
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Let's put some more. Come on.

207
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,120
That's the best idea
I've ever had in my entire life.

208
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Do you trust me or not?
Am I your cousin or not?

209
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,216
- Does it hurt when I pull it?
- [Manon] No, you're hurting me.

210
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
[chuckles] I'm doing it
just like in those American movies.

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,040
Yup. You'll see you're going to be

212
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
- incognito. You look great.
- Ah!

213
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,960
- Nobody will recognize you.
- But, nobody ever?

214
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Nobody ever.

215
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,040
<i>Baby, I know you're not answering
cause you're embarrassed.</i>

<i>I told you this whole thing
would end badly.</i>

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,560
<i>Tell me when you wanna come home
to Corsica. I'll buy your ticket.</i>

218
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
- <i>It makes me happy. Okay?</i>
- Oh, God.

219
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,880
- Oh, I can't stand it anymore.
- Okay. Bye, Patoche.

220
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,680
- She's so exhausting. She tires me.
- Ooh, get out.

221
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Whoa, it's mom, I live in Corsica.
[jabbering]

222
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Ugh! Stay away.

223
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,136
- Say hi to Patoche.
- Stay over there.

224
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
- No more Patoche.
- [grunts]

225
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
- [chuckling]
- Do it again.

226
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,280
- It's Mom. No more Mom.
- Ugh! Oh, yeah.

227
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
- You shouldn't...
- Mother. No more mother.

228
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840

- No problem.

- Ugh, Driko!
- No more Driko.

230
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,520
Why do I push myself to keep this thing
in front of my face like this?

231
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
Seriously.
Why don't we leave it in a small box?

232
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,800
Mm-hm, with miniature key.

233

It's done! No more problems!

239
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,560
And no more Guillaume!

240

- Ooh, it looks bad!

264
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,936
- Thanks. It was your idea!
- Do you have a clock in here?

265
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
Oh, fuck! I'm gonna be late for work!

[Léa] No! Oh, fuck!

267
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,400
[pants]
It's 7:48 p.m., we slept all day.

268
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,320
No, it isn't! Calm down.
We never set the time on the oven.

269
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, yeah! I need to get that fixed.

270
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,976
- What, the oven?
- No, my phone.

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800
- No hang on! Wait, wait.
- What? What?

272
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,720
- What?
- One second, I'm thinking.

273
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,960
Stop thinking. We're clearly total morons.
That's messed up, what we did.

274
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm not so sure. Maybe not.

275
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Maybe it was actually a genius idea.

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
[chuckles]
You're still drunk.

277
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Look at us. Don't you want to start over?

278
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,720
With a clean slate, huh!
Reclaim our fucking dignity!

279
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

280
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,080
See, yes! We're onto something!
I swear we're on the right track.

281
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,800
Actually, we need to do uh,
a sort of uh... cure.

282
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,760
Yeah, a cure. You know, like when um...

283
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,360
Like purifying your body,
you know, and mind.

284
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,576
- Like some people do.
- Who are these people, you say?

285
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,760
- Léa.
- Yes?

286
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,096
You can't live your life like this, Léa,

287
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,480
with the sword of Heracles
hanging over your head.

288
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
It's Damocles, Manon.

289
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
- But it's fine.
- It's Damocles?

290
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
- Yeah, it's Damocles.
- I'm an idiot.

291
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,120
I spent my life on the Internet

292
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,280
watching stupid videos when I should
read books. You know, I'm uncultured!

293
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
No, you're not.

294
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,280
A little, sure. No!

295
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
Who cares, you've got other qualities.
Okay, anyway, I don't see the connection

296
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,640
- with, this sudden idea of doing a detox.
- Detox!

297
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,520
- That's the word!
- No!

298
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,256
- That's what we need to do, Léa.
- No. Still, no.

299
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
- Yes.
- No.

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Okay.

301
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,480
What if it helps you with Guillaume?

302
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm listening.

303
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,400
- If you're off the grid, no more stalking.
- Mm. Yeah.

304
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
- You leave him alone.
- Mm-hm.

305
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,400
Well then maybe Guillaume
will agree to withdraw his complaint.

306
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
Interesting.

307
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,000
You could start over. Right?
You'd be free.

308
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,960
I would. With wonderful goals.

309
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,520
We need to do this detox.

310
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,280
- We're gonna do it.
- Of course.

311
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,280
You know why? Because I'm tired
of people telling me what to do.

312
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,840
What to say, what to eat,
what to think, what to sing.

313
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
Guillaume withdrew his complaint.
Hold on. Hold on.

314
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
- That would mean he regrets.
- Maybe!

315
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
- Definitely.
- And actually, I'm tired.

316
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,736
- Of wearing those tiny dresses...
- Of course, yeah.

It doesn't suit me at all. Right?

318
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Oh, Guillaume. He'll invite me
to our favorite restaurant.

319
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,120
The small Japanese joint in Belleville.

320
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
We'll toast with two glasses of Rosé.

321
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,320
And he'll look at me in the eyes saying,

322
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,080
that he still loves me,
that we can start again.

323
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,960
And I'll tell him
that I still love him too.

324
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
It's going to be crazy, you know.
We'll laugh and we'll cry.

[gasping]

It's great.

328
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
I'll get back with my ex.

329
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,920
Okay, I'm with you on this detox!

[Gagan laughing]

331
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,920
No. No way you can pull this off, girls.
And for a whole month?

332
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,120
Yeah, just like Dry January.
It doesn't end on the 15th, does it?

333
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,656
Or try Smokeout,
without smoking for a month.

334
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,576
- It's always a month.
- The Summer Body challenge.

335
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,680
- [Léa] Exactly.
- I got it.

336
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,440
[chuckles]
It makes sense.

337
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,376
So, you want me
to look after your stuff, right?

338
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,560
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's fine.

Here.

That's... the shop's phone number
so people can reach you.

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,840
Yeah, exactly. And you,
you can use my phone here.

- Aah.
- Aah.

Oh, yeah. What a nice guy,
quick thinking, smart guy.

What do you want me to say?
Don't you agree with me.

349
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,920
Yes? Now, get lost.
I have a Tinder date in five minutes.

don't only have sex at night,

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
right, don't you?

No, I know... that.

355
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,400
It's just that it's been a while
since I've done it in the daytime.

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,840
- All right.
- Right.

Yes, you are. I told you earlier
I'm doing a phone detox.

You never listen to anything I say.

She doesn't get it.

I wrote down the numbers
for the whole family.

- Now give me the shops one.
- Here.

But could you tell my mother not to call
Gagan's shop every two seconds?

00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Like whenever she's got crap to tell me.

- No worries.

I don't mind if you tell Guillaume
about the detox.

Maybe Julien is seeing him too?

- [Léa] You never know.

And Audrey, uh, just so I know.

526
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Are we whispering on account of Pablo
or because of my selfish brother?

527
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,560
He was on night shift for 48 hours
and since his Ph.D. is coming...

528
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,296
Of course he prefers sleeping
on the couch,

529
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,616
that way he can easily annoy you.

530
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,896
- All right, let's go.
- He pisses me off.

531
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,096
- Thanks for your help.
- No worries.

532

[Manon] Do you need your towel?

533
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,720
No, don't bother. Keep it. All good.

534
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,720
- [Manon] Okay.
- See you.

535
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,960
Thanks, Audrey.

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
- I've never seen you look so good.
- Really? Yeah.

620
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,880
- You too.
- [Manon] Thanks.

621
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
[Audrey] Hi!

622
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,600
What the hell? Now they'll never
warn us before they visit.

623
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
This is an emergency,
so be happy I have your keys.

624
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,480
I have two bad news, one for each of you.

625
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,600
- Who should I start with?
- [phone vibrates, pings]

626
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
[smacks lips]

627
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
[sighs]

628
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,920
Manon, your mom is coming this weekend.

629
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,840
Impossible. She'd never close
her restaurant for the weekend.

630
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes. She called,
she's coming for Julien's Ph.D.

631
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,360
[scoffs]

632
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,120
What are you talking about?
She doesn't give a shit at...

633
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,680
[gasping]
Oh, my God! She's coming for me.

634
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,376
Actually, you're like
a giant notification,

635
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,920
you pop up without warning
even when no one asked you a thing.

636
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,920
- [chuckles]
- I'm glad you find it funny,

637
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
'cause the next one won't be
and it's for you.

638
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,040
It's popping up without warning.
It's about Julien's Ph.D. presentation.

639
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,320
[inhales, exhales]
Guillaume's coming.

640
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,040
With a plus one.

641
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,040
With a plus one?
[chuckles]

642
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,080
What does that mean? Who?
Who's the plus one?

643
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,440
Who else could it be, if not me?
I don't understand.

644
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,640
Who is it? It's a girl?
[nervous chuckle]

645
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
[chuckling]
Which girl?

646
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
[panting]

647
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,480
Okay, who is it, who is it?
I don't understand.

648
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,000
Who? Tell me.
It must be a really good friend.

649
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,520
No, wait, is it a cat?

650
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,920
It's an animal? It's a pussy cat.
Shit, it's a pussy!

651
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,680
Whose pussy is it? Who is it?
Tell me who the fucking plus one is!

652
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,016
- [Manon] No! No! No!
- [Léa] No!

653
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,216
- Léa! Calm down.
- [Léa] Give it to me.

654
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
[Manon] Stop, Léa! Take it!

655
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,016
- [Léa] Give it to me!
- [Audrey] I don't have it.

656
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,136
- [Manon] Stop it!
- [Léa] Where is it?

657
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,200
[all] No!

658
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
[cracks]

659
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,040
[closing theme music playing]
