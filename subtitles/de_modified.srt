1
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,245
A guy who sells drugs on the Internet.
He's gone!###drugs:drogen:4.55###

2
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:36,845
That's probably how you imagined it.

3
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,365
But I'm sorry to disappoint you.

4
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,365
That petty criminal there isn't me.

5
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:43,445
But rather one of my many copycats.###copycats:nachahmer:3.14###

6
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,165
What did the boy do?###boy:junge:5.31###

7
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,245
Let's see.

8
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,365
He didn't adequately secure
his shop's database###database:datenbank:4.11###

9
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:52,045
from investigators' injection attacks.###attacks:angriffe:4.28###

10
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,525
And he was constantly bragging about his
"part-time job" as a flirting tactic.

11
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:56,525
Not ideal.

12
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:59,845
If you're selling large quantities
of drugs on the Internet,###drugs:drogen:4.55###

13
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,485
there's one thing
you should never do--

14
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,125
Tell total strangers about it.

15
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:08,125
Unless, of course,
Netflix calls and tells you

16
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:09,845
they want to do a
series about your life.###life:leben:5.86###

17
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,365
Good morning!###morning:morgen:5.43###

18
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,765
What's that book?
My welcome-back gift.

19
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:34,245
"Moritz: Skype later?"

20
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,765
Marie! "Lisa: No, I can't."

21
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:39,485
Is this your whole WhatsApp history?###history:verlauf:4.59###

22
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,205
Yes. From the year that she was gone.

23
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,445
How creepy is that?

24
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,125
Goodbye, come back safe.

25
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:14,645
Hey! Welcome back
to the land of limited opportunities!

26
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:19,325
Thanks. Wow, you look wrecked.

27
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,885
Same old Moritz. Thank you!
Please, no phones here.

28
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:25,365
If I'm gone, they've found the bomb.###bomb:bombe:4.07###

29
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,221
Yeah, I just wanted to ask when I can
give you your welcome-home present?

30
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:31,845
Moritz, our connection's really bad.
Can we just talk later?

31
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,885
Wait. Okay. Now it's better.

32
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,845
I was going to give it to you
at the airport, but...###airport:flughafen:4.75###

33
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,261
So, young lady, hello?
Since the flight was so delayed,

34
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,845
I thought-- Wait a second.

35
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,565
We have to look in here, too.

36
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,205
Here. Have fun.###fun:spaß:5.22###

37
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:44,525
There's nothing inside.

38
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,605
Is everything okay?

39
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:50,365
I wanted to talk about this later
in person, but--

40
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:51,621
Please end the conversation now.

41
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,605
Please, this is really important!

42
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,445
Well...

43
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:58,765
You know...

44
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,445
I think I need some time
to myself right now.

45
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:08,485
It has nothing to do with you, I...

46
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,005
It's just, I'm more scared now
of coming back

47
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,085
than I was of leaving a year ago.###year:jahr:5.84###

48
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,045
So I--

49
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,285
Maybe for now, could we take a break?###break:pause:4.63###

50
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,925
Hang up and close the suitcase.
Sorry.###suitcase:koffer:4.19###

51
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,685
A netflix original series

52
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,565
Hi, I am Moritz Zimmermann.

53
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,285
I'm 17 years old###years:jahre:5.82###

54
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:47,125
and this is my generation.

55
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:49,485
Generation Z.

56
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:54,365
Everyone here has the entirety of
mankind's knowledge in their pockets.###knowledge:wissen:5.55###

57
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,141
They could become famous
with a single click,

58
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:58,645
or change the world
without leaving their bedroom.###world:welt:5.66###

59
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,805
Limitless technological possibilities.###possibilities:möglichkeiten:4.8###

60
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,845
And what do we do with it?
Face swap!

61
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:08,605
No one tries to be special anymore.
And why should they?###one:eine:6.8###

62
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:12,845
Online, you can pretend you have
the most exciting life in the world,###world:welt:5.66###

63
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,645
when in reality... Shit!###Shit:scheiße:5.12###

64
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:16,805
Well...

65
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,285
And because I don't go along with it,
I'm an outsider.

66
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:24,005
Fine with me. After all,
everyone successful used to be a nerd.

67
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,765
Guys like us,
who everyone saw as losers

68
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,445
until eventually it clicks,
and they prove everyone wrong.

69
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,701
Are you coming?
This, by the way, is the day###day:tag:5.69###

70
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,565
it clicked for me.

71
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,605
If I log in to her account, that means
we don't trust each other anymore.

72
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,685
You tell your best friend
that your girlfriend dumped you

73
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,885
only after hours of cross-examination,
and you're talking about trust?###trust:vertrauen:4.79###

74
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,165
We're just taking a break!###break:pause:4.63###

75
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:50,845
Google says that "taking a break"
is breaking up for cowards.###break:pause:4.63###

76
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,405
Maybe you should just forget about her
for a few months.###months:monate:5.04###

77
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,765
Are you even listening to me?
Yes.

78
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:05,405
Now we can finally really
bust our asses for MyTems.

79
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,006
Then when we're millionaires,
Lisa will come running back.###millionaires:millionäre:3.22###

80
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,165
That's how women are.

81
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:11,765
Yeah, maybe.

82
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,165
Or she has someone new.

83
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:21,885
Who's that? Dan?

84
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,045
Dan, the guy who supplies
half the school with drugs.###drugs:drogen:4.55###

85
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,645
The brother of Melanie, with the tits.

86
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,085
You know Melanie with the tits, right?

87
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:37,205
Since when does Lisa hang out
with guys like that?

88
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:40,605
Tall, handsome, popular.
Yeah, not really her type.

89
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:42,685
Right.

90
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:46,165
"Daniel Riffert. Goes by 'Dan.'"

91
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:50,045
Eighteen years old.
Goes around shirtless, even in April.###years:jahre:5.82###

92
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,125
What a dipshit.

93
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:54,125
His father played for the national
team for about two seconds.###seconds:sekunden:4.78###

94
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:55,965
His mom manages
the Rinseln Savings Bank.

95
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:57,245
Typical rich kid.

96
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,285
But his parents want him
to earn his own money like they did.###money:geld:5.59###

97
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,925
The perfect family.###family:familie:5.41###

98
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:05,285
He spent six weeks in South America
last summer.###summer:sommer:5.08###

99
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:07,205
Of course he did.
Super intense time.###time:zeit:5.99###

100
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,245
Life-changing experiences.###Life:leben:5.86###

101
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:12,005
Does Capoeira and goes jogging
five times a week.###week:woche:5.38###

102
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,325
But not as fast as you'd think.

103
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,725
He's gluten intolerant,
uses too many emoticons,

104
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:19,485
and likes realgrumpycat
and the national team on Facebook.

105
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,525
What an asshole. And--###asshole:arschloch:4.35###

106
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,605
Fucking Rinseln. No reception again.

107
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,005
Let's just focus on the pitch, okay?

108
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,685
Otherwise,
I'll want to "take a break," too.###break:pause:4.63###

109
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:32,565
Hey, Moritz.

110
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,005
We're sitting over there.

111
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:38,005
Moritz? Hello?!

112
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:43,325
What? I spent 689 hours###hours:stunden:5.36###

113
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,445
programming what is likely
the most advanced, most secure,

114
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,925
and hottest online shop system
in the world.###world:welt:5.66###

115
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,205
So?

116
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:57,125
It has the password stored for the MyTems
shop and everything else on my server.###password:passwort:4.04###

117
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,765
In case I...###case:fall:5.54###

118
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:01,925
In case he dies.###case:fall:5.54###

119
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:04,765
That's the thing about Lenny.

120
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,645
According to his doctors,
he should be dead by now.

121
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,805
So he stopped
asking his doctors about it.

122
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:16,405
The PIN is the date
we first had the idea for MyTems.###idea:idee:5.2###

123
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,565
Okay. What do you mean, "Okay"?

124
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,965
I give you the key to my Sistine
Chapel, and you just say "Okay"?###key:schlüssel:4.42###

125
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,325
Okay.
This pitch is really important to me!

126
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:25,685
Don't fuck it up!

127
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,845
Just so I understand correctly,

128
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:33,565
there are people who pay real money
for computer game swords?###game:spiel:5.49###

129
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:36,725
Obviously! How else would you kill
a Level 100 Blood Elf Paladin?

130
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:37,685
Innovation competition

131
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,541
It's true. One billion people
across the globe

132
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:42,045
play online games
such as World of Warcraft...###games:spiele:5.13###

133
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,245
League of Legends, or Fortnite.

134
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,045
And that's our big opportunity.

135
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,085
We're the eBay for online gamers.###gamers:gamer:3.53###

136
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:53,165
The eBay for online gamers! Wow!###gamers:gamer:3.53###

137
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,565
Innovation competition

138
00:09:58,645 --> 00:09:59,645
Yes.

139
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:04,285
Until now,
if you wanted to trade rare items

140
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:07,245
or successful accounts
for online games,###games:spiele:5.13###

141
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:11,245
you had to go into
shady Darknet forums

142
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:15,525
somewhere between drugs,
real weapons, and freak sex.###weapons:waffen:4.73###

143
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:22,085
We proudly present...

144
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,285
MyTems! "Trade game items online."###Trade:handel:4.65###

145
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,045
Looking for a chromatic sword?###sword:schwert:4.1###

146
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:31,125
Only a total moron would pass that up.

147
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,485
Sorry. That was your time.
Thank you very much.###time:zeit:5.99###

148
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,805
Wait a second, please.
We'll take a quick photo, okay?###photo:foto:5.02###

149
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,245
Next will be "I love Rinseln," 7B.

150
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,965
And smile!

151
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,725
Great. Keep it up!

152
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:51,325
And breathe!

153
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,925
Has he already contacted you?

154
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:54,285
This happens to be
the expression you make###expression:ausdruck:4.53###

155
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,325
when you realize that you don't know
your own girlfriend anymore.###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

156
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,765
For those of you who,
like me at that point,###point:punkt:5.0###

157
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,565
don't have a clue what those
pills are, and what's in them,###pills:pillen:3.62###

158
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,725
put your phone down
and listen to Lenny's mother.###mother:mutter:5.26###

159
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,085
It will be important later.

160
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,725
Everyone else can press
the "skip" button.

161
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:14,165
Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine,
or MDMA for short,###methylamphetamine:methylamphetamin:1.2###

162
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:19,165
is the main psychoactive agent
in the party drug ecstasy.###drug:droge:3.75###

163
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:22,725
The pills come in all
shapes and colors.###colors:farben:4.57###

164
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:26,965
And they all have different additives
and MDMA contents.###additives:zusatzstoffe:2.85###

165
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:31,005
In the best case,
it keeps you up all night,###night:nacht:5.36###

166
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,205
in the worst case,
it lands you in the emergency room.###case:fall:5.54###

167
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:39,045
The effects set in
after about 20 minutes.###minutes:minuten:5.39###

168
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:44,565
Your brain releases huge quantities of
serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine,###quantities:mengen:4.28###

169
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,885
which means,
your body produces pure bliss.

170
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:52,885
Your blood pressure rises, you're awake,
attentive and extremely empathetic.###pressure:druck:4.96###

171
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:55,525
You experience every feeling
more intensely.###feeling:gefühl:5.05###

172
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:58,685
Freedom, tenderness, love.###tenderness:zärtlichkeit:3.27###

173
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,205
And the downside?

174
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:04,165
How do you think you'd feel
the next morning###morning:morgen:5.43###

175
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:07,605
after your brain has blown its
entire supply of happiness hormones?###hormones:hormone:3.52###

176
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,205
Do you maybe want to dip your toes in,
or is it your time of the month again?

177
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,005
Say hi to Lenny. I can give you two
a ride home, by the way.

178
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:23,285
What are you two
doing here? Get moving.

179
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,205
Okay, last few minutes!

180
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,285
One, two, three.

181
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:57,005
Hey, I just messaged you.

182
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:05,085
I'll get some. I'm meeting my
secret source today anyway.###source:quelle:4.83###

183
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:08,045
Well, it's the only source in Rinseln.

184
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,325
Lisa, can we talk a second?

185
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,845
Hi. Hey, I'm Dan.

186
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,365
Yes, I know. And you are?

187
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:16,925
Moritz.

188
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:18,685
Lisa's boyfriend.

189
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:23,685
Wow, crazy. I thought you were--

190
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:25,605
We're taking a break.
We're taking a break.###break:pause:4.63###

191
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,725
Can we talk?

192
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:31,205
Okay, everyone get changed!

193
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,805
I gotta go, sorry. See you later.

194
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,085
Yeah, okay.

195
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:48,285
See you around, Maurice!

196
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:51,085
Yes,
I know. The swimsuit is distracting.

197
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,805
But can we concentrate on the facts
for a moment?###facts:fakten:4.49###

198
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:58,245
My girlfriend is throwing a
welcome-back party I'm not invited to.###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

199
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:01,565
And she didn't ask me, but rather
the good-looking school dealer,

200
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,685
to get drugs for everyone.
And to keep an eye on them!###drugs:drogen:4.55###

201
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,445
Fuck!

202
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:24,325
It's annoying, you have to re-calibrate
and heat the printing bed every time.###bed:bett:4.94###

203
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,685
Why?

204
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,565
Because of warping, men!###men:männer:5.3###

205
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,845
You're totally clueless!

206
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:32,845
When you're done,
put the 3D-printer back.

207
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:36,045
And when you want to use it again,
ask the man with the magic key.###key:schlüssel:4.42###

208
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,325
Lenny? I need your help.###help:hilfe:5.24###

209
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,405
Just on a scale of 1 to 10,###scale:skala:3.86###

210
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,205
how little does it matter to you
that you drove MyTems off a cliff

211
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,405
because all you could think about
was Lisa?

212
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,645
You ran here?

213
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,101
I guess it really is important to you.

214
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,485
I have a cramp! Lift your arms.###arms:arme:4.71###

215
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:02,125
What a pussy!
You just focus on your dick.

216
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:04,605
It's about Lisa.

217
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,645
I really need your help.###help:hilfe:5.24###

218
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,605
If it doesn't work out, I'll never
mention her again. I promise.

219
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,125
We'll figure it out with MyTems.

220
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:28,605
Okay, pick me up at my house
with your car in two hours.###hours:stunden:5.36###

221
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,165
What's the plan?

222
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:31,685
Good question, Lenny.###question:frage:5.57###

223
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,765
The plan...

224
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:37,565
to win back my girlfriend by
making sure that Daniel Riffert###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

225
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:40,205
shows up at the party empty-handed.

226
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,845
That's your plan? Yes.

227
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,605
Okay, Moritz. How sure are you?

228
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:54,165
Fifty-five.

229
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:57,605
You're only 55 percent sure
that Daniel buys his drugs here?###drugs:drogen:4.55###

230
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,045
Look, Lenny.

231
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,485
Daniel posts all his jogging results.###results:ergebnisse:4.9###

232
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,045
He always runs at five p.m.,
the same route every time.

233
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:09,605
But on Mondays,
he stops at this pizzeria-- Cavalli--

234
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:10,845
For about one hour.###hour:stunde:5.08###

235
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,325
Maybe he goes riding here.
Riding?

236
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:16,125
There's not a single horse
on his Instagram.###horse:pferd:4.43###

237
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:20,285
Moritz, it's a pizzeria. Carbs!

238
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:22,725
Cheat day.
That's what I thought at first, too.

239
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:26,045
But after that, he runs for 45 minutes
at eight miles an hour.###minutes:minuten:5.39###

240
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:30,205
Then he picks it up here
and eats it later.

241
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:33,485
Cold pizza? After running
through half of Rinseln with it?

242
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,245
Besides, he lives by Pinocchio Pizza,
and it has five stars on Yelp.###stars:sterne:4.44###

243
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,605
Okay, Sherlock.

244
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:41,525
And that’s enough for you to go in
there and order a pizza a la MDMA?

245
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,205
Wait. I'm not finished.

246
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:50,725
Daniel fucking Riffert, Mr. Perfect,
is allergic to gluten.

247
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,845
Okay, good point.###point:punkt:5.0###

248
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:56,205
And if anything goes wrong,
I have something of a Plan B.

249
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:16,365
Okay, all set.

250
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:38,245
Can I help you?

251
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:42,925
Where is that in Italy?

252
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:47,325
That's Albania! Nice.

253
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,965
I actually--

254
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:57,965
Everything on the table is one euro.

255
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,045
I heard that you...

256
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,965
that you sell ecstasy.

257
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,045
That you sell ecstasy.

258
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,405
Fuck off. Yeah, okay.

259
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,325
I'd really like to buy some from you.

260
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:21,485
Let's just say I had what you want.

261
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:25,125
Give me one reason
why I should sell it to you.###reason:grund:5.37###

262
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,125
Because for one...

263
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:33,045
And secondly, I don't know you.

264
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,285
So, it's-- And third...

265
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:39,965
you don't look like someone
who's ever had any fun in his life.###life:leben:5.86###

266
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,005
My girlfriend Lisa...###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

267
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:53,525
just came back from a year
in the US.###year:jahr:5.84###

268
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,645
And she's totally changed.

269
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,805
Maybe it's the tap water over there.
I've heard they pump it full of hormones.###hormones:hormone:3.52###

270
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,685
Anyway, now she's back

271
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,645
and she wants a break
from our relationship.###break:pause:4.63###

272
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:13,445
She's suddenly into party drugs and a
guy who's way better-looking than me.###drugs:drogen:4.55###

273
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,765
Not that Lisa cares about that, but...

274
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,125
it does make you think...

275
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:22,405
as a young man.###man:mann:5.73###

276
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:28,885
So I thought as a welcome-back gift,
I could get her some ecstasy.###gift:geschenk:4.55###

277
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:36,925
To show her that now I'm open
to all kinds of fun.###fun:spaß:5.22###

278
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:43,245
And because I'm convinced that
it's the best way to win her back.###way:weg:5.67###

279
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,085
Right?

280
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:48,285
How much do you want?

281
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,165
All of it.

282
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,805
I wish I were invited to that party.

283
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,845
Here. That's all I got.

284
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:12,725
But I'll need another
five of those bills.

285
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,165
Would it be okay if I brought
the rest of the money later?

286
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:17,965
No problem. Yeah?

287
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,045
Sure. Really?

288
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:22,005
Of course not! Now fuck off.
Go back to Mommy.

289
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,285
Are you fucking insane?

290
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,605
Did you just--? It's too late.

291
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:42,005
The photo's already on the cloud.###photo:foto:5.02###

292
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,005
If I'm not out of here in two minutes,###minutes:minuten:5.39###

293
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,485
that photo will be sent
to all my Facebook friends.###photo:foto:5.02###

294
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:07,165
Including the GPS coordinates

295
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:09,405
and an explanation
of how you earn your living here.###explanation:erklärung:4.69###

296
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,565
Bullshit.

297
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,765
You have 100 seconds.###seconds:sekunden:4.78###

298
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:23,605
You just made a big mistake.
A very big mistake.

299
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:33,725
You have to understand,
this is an absolute emergency.

300
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,965
I'll pay you the rest of the money
very soon.###money:geld:5.59###

301
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,245
Promise.

302
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:53,565
He believed that?

303
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,805
I didn't know you
were such a good liar.

304
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:59,645
I could have programmed it for real.
Sure.

305
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,925
But you don't have
any Facebook friends.

306
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:13,525
So, Mr. Zimmermann,
did you shoot anyone yet this week?###week:woche:5.38###

307
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:16,165
No, not this week, for a change.

308
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:23,685
But you know,
police work is like fishing, actually.###fishing:angeln:3.69###

309
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:26,805
They're always biting for one guy...

310
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,485
but for the other guy they don't bite.

311
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:33,445
Moritz.

312
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:37,365
But the thing is that...

313
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:39,445
the fish don't bite for one guy###fish:fisch:4.34###

314
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:42,685
so that the other guy can catch them.

315
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,085
Do you understand?

316
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,205
No one really knows
what's going on under the water.###water:wasser:5.32###

317
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,885
Marie! Are you coming?

318
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,965
So, boys...
what's going down this evening?###evening:abend:5.32###

319
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,685
You know your son.###son:sohn:5.22###

320
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:08,565
We're going to Lisa's party.
We'll supply all the drugs,###drugs:drogen:4.55###

321
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:11,205
and a bus full of hookers
is coming at midnight.###midnight:mitternacht:4.09###

322
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,445
Lenny, you're such a character.

323
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,565
Moritz, that's enough.

324
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:20,045
What did we say?
No phones at the table.

325
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:22,245
Exactly.

326
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:27,005
I don't want linguine!

327
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:32,765
You know what? Let it ring.
We're eating dinner.

328
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:37,685
What if it's important?
We never get important calls!

329
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,445
Answer it! Answer it yourself!

330
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:45,245
Text message received.###message:nachricht:4.8###

331
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,205
Hello, Mr. Zimmermann.

332
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,405
I have some
interesting information for you.

333
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:51,525
We don't know each other

334
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:54,845
but Daniel Riffert sells ecstasy
to students here at our school.

335
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:59,005
He's carrying drugs on him right now.###drugs:drogen:4.55###

336
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:03,005
He is currently doing Capoeira
training at No. 12, Witt Street.

337
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,245
Wow, he's really hot!

338
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:07,725
Received on Monday...
Don't you have to go there?

339
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,245
"Imminent danger" or whatever?###danger:gefahr:4.94###

340
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:12,845
To be honest,
I didn't understand where it is.

341
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,205
Capoeira. It's a martial art.

342
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:18,085
Twelve Witt Street.
Go get him, Dad!

343
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,565
Finally a bite!###bite:biss:3.82###

344
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:29,805
Ute, we just got an anonymous tip.###tip:tipp:4.51###

345
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:31,845
Violation of the Narcotics Act.###Violation:verstoß:3.83###

346
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,645
Are you sure
you want to give that as a gift?###gift:geschenk:4.55###

347
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:47,765
And where did you even
get the money for it?###money:geld:5.59###

348
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,245
Moritz, I asked you a question!

349
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,485
From our project account. What?###account:konto:4.44###

350
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:56,205
From the MyTems account.###account:konto:4.44###

351
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,365
I'll pay it back.
Dude, are you insane?

352
00:25:58,445 --> 00:25:59,525
Lenny. Hi, Fritzi.

353
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:04,005
Moritz! What are you doing here?

354
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,765
Aren't you and Lisa--?
What's Daniel doing here?###Lisa--:lisa:4.34###

355
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:30,605
Same thing he always does.
Look good, talk, and hand out drugs.###drugs:drogen:4.55###

356
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:33,525
He's been bragging all night
that he was almost arrested.

357
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,165
But they couldn't prove anything.

358
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,965
He even sent around a selfie
he took with a cop. Look.

359
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,965
But they only found four pills on him.###pills:pillen:3.62###

360
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,645
I already saw that.

361
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:58,645
So that you can understand
how important all this is to me,

362
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:03,245
ever since the day my mother left me
sitting here in Rinseln,###mother:mutter:5.26###

363
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:07,445
Lisa has been the only woman
in my life that means something to me.###life:leben:5.86###

364
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,525
Mo, hi!

365
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,165
Feel my skin, it's really soft.###skin:haut:4.79###

366
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,485
Feel it, really.

367
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:28,205
Can you come with me?
Forget that jerk for a second.

368
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:29,765
I brought you something.

369
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:31,845
Relax, okay? Here.

370
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,405
Come on. Hey!

371
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:37,325
I'm responsible for them.

372
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,885
Your negative vibes
will give them a bad trip,

373
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,365
and I'll have to clean up the mess.

374
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:43,965
Yeah.

375
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:46,725
What would we do without him?

376
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,445
Daniel Riffert.

377
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:54,165
With his protein shakes
and his stupid Capoeira,

378
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:55,885
and his constant shirtless photos

379
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:59,245
and 1,764 Instagram followers,###followers:follower:3.44###

380
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:01,165
half of which are bought.###half:hälfte:4.98###

381
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,445
Yeah, what are you looking at?

382
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:06,205
Namaste to all the Riffert fans
at the click farm in India!

383
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:08,405
But you know what?

384
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:10,765
We smart people
aren't impressed by that.

385
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,805
What's your point?

386
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:19,245
Lisa and I are going to the US
after we graduate.

387
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,325
Wow.

388
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:22,205
To study. Together.

389
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,005
And start careers.

390
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,525
And you know what happens
to super-popular guys like you?

391
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,165
What?

392
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:33,885
In a few years, you'll be collecting
dry cleaning for guys like me.###years:jahre:5.82###

393
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,525
Asshole.

394
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,765
What makes you think
that you of all people

395
00:28:43,845 --> 00:28:45,605
will ever achieve anything?

396
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:51,005
If I understood her properly, it wasn't
just your own mother who left you.###mother:mutter:5.26###

397
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:54,525
Even your girlfriend has realized
that you don't have any balls.###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

398
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,765
Oh, right, I mean your ex-girlfriend.###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

399
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,005
Okay, people, the party continues.

400
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,165
Yeah, I know.

401
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:35,885
Right now I look like the guy who will
pick up the dry cleaning for Daniel.

402
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:47,765
Let me know next time you use our
money to buy drugs for your girlfriend!###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

403
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:48,965
I thought we were a team!

404
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:54,405
The money will be back on our account
in three days! I promise!###days:tage:5.38###

405
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,445
For the "freshly baked"
mytems ceo love, mom

406
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:51,645
But like I said...

407
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,725
And click.
