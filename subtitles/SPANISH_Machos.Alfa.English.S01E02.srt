00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,840
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,720
CHANNEL 99

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,960
All right, you have to sign right here

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and here and right here.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,880
We've given you everything
that you're entitled to.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,680
How nice of you, complying with the law.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,920
Do you need anything else?

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,960
My whiteboard.

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,880
Pedro, I don't know
why you were fired, but you...

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,720
The glass ceiling shattered
and fell on top of me.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,960
Okay, I just wanted
to tell you that I admire you.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
I think you're an amazing guy.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Gee, thanks.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I agree with you.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,520
Would you be interested
in joining my team?

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
As assistant manager?

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,880
Do you really think
I'd put my brilliance

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,600
at the service of an opportunist

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,600
who was handpicked as some
kind of feminist affirmative action?

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Hmm. It's not my fault
that things are changing, Pedro.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,280
You sure?

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,240
They pay you to think up idiotic shows
that will get high ratings

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,480
so they can advertise hair products,

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,920
creams for antiaging,
cereals with whole grains

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
and other mass-produced pieces of garbage

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,320
to all these silly little women

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,280
who've bought into
the hyped-up empowerment bullshit.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,680
And who pays you?

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,160
A crazy old man.

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,800
Sorry, honey, but you're
just another pawn of the patriarchy.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,080
And you're a bastard.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,000
Dumb pawn.

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
Hey, what are you doing with my phone?

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,880
Shh! I'm shipping you.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,800
- Shi... what?
- Getting you a date.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
No, no. No more dates.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,480
- Really, I'm not going on another.
- Relax, the same woman.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,800
- Who, Ángeles?
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,720
But I slammed the door in her face.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,120
Yeah, that's why I had
to work on an apology.

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,560
She'll be your body number one.
Would nine o'clock work?

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
My body number one?

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,680
You have to erase Mom
from your body's memory.

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
And for that,
you gotta sleep with ten women.

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,160
- With ten?
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,440
With ten! Where the hell
did you get that crazy idea?

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
- I'm sending you the link.
- But what?

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,320
This is all nonsense,
seriously.

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Uh, first off, I don't need
to erase anything about your mom, okay?

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,160
She's been completely erased by now.
Did it on her own.

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
You're lying.
You have to take the test at the end.

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,720
And I actually like being a bachelor.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
What test?

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Hey, Dad, why even get up in the morning?

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
You're like the living dead.
You've given up.

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,800
I need a good role model.
Someone to look up to.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
But ten women's too much.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Really, I've only been
with four or five in total.

59
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,240
Everything moves quicker now.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
Dad, YOLO!

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
YOLO?

62
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,960
You only live once.

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,680
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR EX?
WHO ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP?

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
SHE DID. I DIDN'T EXPECT IT AT ALL

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,840
Hmm.

66
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,720
I just don't... don't understand it.

67
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,160
I don't see the need for it at all.

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,400
All right, we'll just carry on
like everyone else then.

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,680
And we'll just let this hang
over us until we become distant.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,320
Yeah, like every other damn couple.

72
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
It doesn't matter. Forget it.
You're just not emotionally ready now.

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
- I've lived more than you.
- Hey!

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Hey, cool it, Obi-Wan, okay?
I've been around the block.

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,080
I mean... I... I've seen some crazy...
wow, crazy stuff.

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,640
It's very difficult to find people
who are mature and sure of themselves.

77
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
- You think I'm immature?
- You're scared shitless.

78
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Scared of what?

79
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,560
Admit it, darling.
You couldn't handle an open relationship.

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,080
I mean, come on. Can you really
see me doing stuff with another girl?

81
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,480
Yeah, why not?

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,320
Yeah, with some young 20-something girl
with perky tits and a tight ass,

83
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,720
both of us bare naked,
writhing in bed, sweating it out, huh?

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,040
- Is that a yes?
- No, don't put words in my mouth.

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,320
Oh, because I was getting
all horny listening to that.

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,536
- We'll talk it through.
- What is there to talk about?

87
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm going. I'm late already.

88
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,680
I said no, okay?

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,760
I made coffee, and I just went
and bought some fresh croissants.

90
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,280
- Don't buy me this junk. I'll eat it all.
- Wanna go out tonight?

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
Mmm! Let's save money
and have dinner here.

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,680
I bought these vegan hamburgers that'll
make you forget about steak forever.

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Save for what?
I'm sure they'll start fighting over me.

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Enjoy your freedom.
Come on and reinvent yourself.

95
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,360
Didn't you always say
you never had time for anything? Hmm?

96
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,520
Read, hang out with your buddies, hmm.

97
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,120
Install the new kitchen faucet.
I don't know, live a little.

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,720
What? Faucet?

99
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,840
Ta-da! This faucet.

100
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,400
What's wrong with the one we've got?

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,760
This one's like those industrial ones.
It stretches like a garden hose.

102
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
Good morning.

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,496
- Good morning, Patri.
- She doesn't know, hmm?

104
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,720
Hmm, there's no need to tell her.
She may quit.

105
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,280
Wanna spend the day together
and go shopping?

106
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Oh, more spending.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,376
Well, we could just walk
and hold hands. That's free.

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
Hmm. I'm meeting Cynthia. She was gifted
a beauty treatment and invited me along.

109
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
- How nice of your sister, the influencer.
- Hmm.

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
- Content creator. Thank you.
- All right.

111
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,920
- Are you off today, sir?
- Taking a sick day.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,640
Ah. Enjoy it. You work so hard, sir.

113
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,320
Yeah.

114
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay, when would you say that
your sex problems first arose?

115
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,440
You said we were going
to buy a new coffee maker.

116
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
Our sex life was washed away
a long time ago by two tsunamis.

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Iris and Ulises, our two children.

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,440
The one with the pods.

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,400
And he has the sex drive of a plant.

120
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,520
It's 'cause she wants it when I'm tired.
I'm under a lot of stress.

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,280
- I'm a police officer.
- Local.

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,720
Jaywalking, public drinking,
parking violations.

123
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,920
And she's a driving instructor,
which is a whole lot more exciting.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay, I'm gonna stop you there.

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,320
First and foremost, no personal attacks.

126
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,040
Remember that you're on the same team.

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,200
Like many couples,
you have a communication problem.

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,640
My first recommendation is that you talk.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,360
Well, we do talk.
It's the only thing we do.

130
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,520
There's a lot of social pressure
about how much sex a couple should have,

131
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,640
but the important thing is quality.

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,400
And for that, it's important to talk.
To talk about sex without fear.

133
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,440
About each other's tastes,
about what it is you miss.

134
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,600
Well, fucking.

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I had a patient
who was strongly feminist,

136
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
and she was mortified when she was
turned on by being called a slut in bed.

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,760
If it turns you on,
what's the problem with your partner

138
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
calling you a "slut"?

139
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
None at all. If she likes it.

140
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
You'd be surprised
by how many men who are hetero

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,600
would like to be fingered
in the anus by their partner.

142
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
But they don't dare to ask.

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,800
- Would you like me to finger you in your...
- No. Not really, no.

144
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,920
Hmm.

145
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
Is that something you'd like?

146
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,120
Well, like to, no, but...

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,440
You see that? You're talking now.

148
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,240
Oh, my God! Patricia, excuse me.

149
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,760
Sorry, need to come in here?

150
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,240
No, no. Go on, go on.
There is more bathrooms.

151
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
RELIGION FOR SHEEP

152
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,720
- Oh, I didn't know you were here.
- No problem.

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,040
Keep on vacuuming. I'll read upstairs.

154
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,240
Motherfucker.

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,280
<i>Friends, the next step is very easy.</i>

156
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
<i>Now that we've finished
installing the faucet,</i>

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,080
<i>let's check the connection with the valve
that supplies water to the faucet.</i>

158
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,080
<i>It's very easy.</i>

159
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,640
All done.

160
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,680
<i>And as you can see, it works perfectly.</i>

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,720
<i>There's no water coming out.</i>

162
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,280
<i>No leaks at all, no drips.
In short, no issues at all.</i>

163
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,320
- Shut up, asshole.
- Are you okay, sir?

164
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,320
Do you need any help?

165
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
This damn faucet
doesn't work at all.

166
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,560
Oh, I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

167
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, so you know how to fix a faucet.

168
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,920
This is the first time it's happened.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
And it had to be me?

170
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,240
Do you, I don't know, wanna try it again?

171
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Sweetie, if I want bad sex,
I already have my husband.

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,000
Seventeen years.

173
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,240
SWINGING

174
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
Seventeen years of happiness.
And suddenly, she's a different person.

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,440
It's like she's transformed into my enemy.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,800
There's, like, I don't know,

177
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,360
all this silence at home,
all this tension.

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,640
Um, hello?

179
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,840
Yes. Ah, yes, sorry, Jesús.

180
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm taking some notes for the lawsuit.

181
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,360
Okay, on her phone,
I saw the list of calls,

182
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,760
and I saw she'd called her cousin Almudena
160 times in a month.

183
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,080
- I didn't believe it.
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
Plus, I have her number,
and it's different. Ha!

185
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,000
She made such a scene.
She said it was invasion of her privacy.

186
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
You bitch, you're the one cheating on me.

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,600
- Of course. Uh-huh.
- Sure.

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
- Excuse me.
- Hmm.

189
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Tell me.

190
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,880
<i>What are you doing?
I've missed you.</i>

191
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,240
Working now. You all right?

192
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,400
<i>You like me calling you out
of the blue like this?</i>

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
- Hey, I've gotta go. I'm with a client.
<i>- With a client?</i>

195
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,920
Like, at the office or...

196
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,720
- Uh, uh, Luz?
- I assume you've paid for the hotel?

197
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,800
- Thank you.
- All right.

198
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,400
What happened to you, buddy?

199
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,920
- I think I pulled a muscle in my back.
- What's up, you guys?

200
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,320
Where you been, macho man?

201
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,080
Uh, sorting out some business.
Where's Duna?

202
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,760
Picking her kid up. He's sick. Go on,
serve your friends and your parents.

203
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,800
But make sure to charge them though.
I know you.

204
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Hey.

205
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,480
- How are you, sweetie? Mmm! Mmm!
- What are you doing here?

206
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,736
- We've started going on morning walks.
- I'm a guy who needs incentives, my boy.

207
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
Ah!

208
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,440
Look what I brought you.

209
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,920
Mama, I really don't need any food.
I own a restaurant.

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
Well, then why don't you just share them
with the boys?

211
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
Hi, guys. Empanadas with tuna.

212
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
- Thank you.
- Bravo!

213
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,840
Oh, hurry, warm these up.
In the oven, don't nuke them.

214
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,480
Come on, please, I gotta work now.

215
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,800
But we came to see you.
You never come see us.

216
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay, Dad, I've been busy for a while.

217
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Come here. Give it to me, you ingrate.
Thanks, Pili.

218
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,320
They're tuna.

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,280
Have you seen your mom's ass
in those?

220
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,480
She's got the ass of a goddess.

221
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,120
Dad, come on. Get out.

222
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,920
- I love you.
- See you later.

223
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,040
Mmm!

224
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,760
Hey, your parents are proof
that happy marriages do exist.

225
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Look at 'em. I like that.

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Damn, yeah, that's true.

227
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,120
A different generation. Doesn't count.

228
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,720
- Of course they count. They count more.
- No, they don't count.

229
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,640
What are you up to tonight?
Wanna go get drinks?

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
No, I can't.

231
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,560
- Me neither.
- I have a date with Ángeles.

232
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,520
From Tinder? You're back for more?

233
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,520
Oh, no,
Álex convinced her to see me again.

234
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
Oh, Álex got you another date.

235
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,936
- She worries about me. The poor thing.
- Yeah.

236
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,640
Yeah, or she wants to turn your place
into a love shack, you know.

237
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,840
You're such pig. She's only 16 years old.

238
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,680
- She gets laid more than you.
- Well, that's not so hard.

239
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,880
No, my kid doesn't think like you,
you perverts.

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,840
Come on, Santi, accept it.
Álex is messing around. No big deal.

241
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,160
Don't say that. My God!

242
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,560
- She is. She's already punched the V card.
- God damn.

243
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,720
Stuffed the turkey, popped the cherry.

244
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,240
Plugged in the pen drive.

245
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,160
- Um...
- You're really so disgusting.

246
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
You all are a bunch of sickos.

247
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,280
You know that? Every one of you is.

248
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,200
- Hey, she's gonna do a little banging.
- Like I said, sick.

249
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Oh!

250
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,800
LORETO'S DRIVING SCHOOL

251
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>Garage number 11, opening up.</i>

252
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Thank you, you're very kind.

253
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,560
Let's go.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,280
Hope nobody sees us.
I can't believe we're doing this.

255
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
Straight from the garage to the bedroom.

256
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,000
It's so sad coming here with your husband.

257
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,760
- Didn't you want some privacy?
- Yes, I know, but this is so sad.

258
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
A bit.

259
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
Hey, we can always turn around.

260
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,640
No way. Your mom's watching the kids
for once. Come on, let's do it.

261
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,080
All right,
the therapist said we should talk.

262
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,240
- Correct.
- About sex.

263
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,640
Well, let's talk about sex then.

264
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,040
All right. Uh, okay,
but don't take things the wrong way.

265
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,480
- No, no, go on.
- Okay.

266
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,520
Do you have any sexual urges
throughout the day?

267
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,520
I mean, okay,
I'll just... I'll kick things off.

268
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
Do you masturbate?

269
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
I jerk off constantly, Esther.

270
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,720
Where at?

271
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
I don't know, shower, work, anywhere.

272
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,000
- At work?
- Mm-hmm. In the patrol car.

273
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,040
When, uh, Julián goes for coffee, I do it.

274
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,600
Um, eww, that's so disgusting.

275
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Well, you asked.

276
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Okay, what do you think of when you...

277
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,320
- I think of you.
- Luis.

278
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,680
And who do you think about?

279
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,400
Well, I think about other guys.

280
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
But now I'll start thinking
about you.

281
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,640
You can be my new fantasy.

282
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
Oh, okay, okay. Well, I don't mind.

283
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,080
- You like that I think of others?
- Why would I like that?

284
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Some people like that.

285
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,000
Would you like it
if I thought about others?

286
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,560
Why are you asking the same things?

287
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,920
Don't know. It came to mind now.

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,080
Luis, I need you
to take more initiative, okay?

289
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,720
I mean, when you feel horny, come find me.

290
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
If I'm in the kitchen, we'll do it there.

291
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,040
And the kids?

292
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
The kids need new hobbies.
They spend too much time at home, dear.

293
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,320
Yeah, but we've got two,
and hobbies are expensive.

294
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,720
Look, really, this doesn't...
it doesn't make any sense at all.

295
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm like... like naked here,
right here at a hotel.

296
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,440
We came here to fuck,
and I'm not even horny.

297
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,880
No, me either,
because you're telling me off.

298
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
Should we go in the pool?

299
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,720
No way. I'm not going in there.

300
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,840
Honest, I couldn't
be bothered to go out with you again,

301
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
but you really amused me
with your groveling.

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,040
- Yeah. I was very insistent, huh?
- Hmm.

303
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm not normally that annoying.

304
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
I said to myself, "Fuck,
I must really turn him on."

305
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,200
But let me tell you,
having your self-esteem boosted at my age,

306
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,080
well, it really feels so great.

307
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
Yeah, well, good to hear.

308
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Uh, because you know, that isn't...
that's really not my style.

309
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,520
It isn't. Seriously.

310
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,520
So, Santi, tell me about you.
What are you looking for exactly?

311
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,800
Uh, well, well, I...

312
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
- I was married.
- Oh.

313
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,120
But she's dead now.

314
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,160
- Oof!
- She died in a car accident.

315
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,720
- She crashed head-on into a bus.
- Oof!

316
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,160
School bus.
No kids were hurt. Oof, you know.

317
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,120
But anyway, must've seen it on the news.

318
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,120
- It was a big tragedy.
- Uh-uh.

319
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,280
No, actually,
it wasn't on the news after all.

320
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,720
It wasn't on because there was an attack,

321
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,400
an important vote or something.
I don't know. Pandemic.

322
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,520
Something happened that day
and took the spotlight off of it. Yeah.

323
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,880
Yeah. I'm sorry. How hard.

324
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,360
She can really be a bitch. Karma.

325
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
Oh.

326
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
Um, got any kids?

327
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Uh, yes, a daughter.
She's, uh, 16 years old.

328
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,120
But you know, I barely see her.
She has a life of her own and...

329
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,480
Mm, yeah. We both know that, right?
You know, kids at that age.

330
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,840
And what are they like?

331
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,160
They're a different generation.

332
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
They're much more grown-up
than we were back then.

333
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
More grown-up, what do you mean by that?

334
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,760
Look, Santi,
I lost my virginity when I was 22,

335
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,880
and these little pricks are
having orgies when they're 15 years old.

336
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,120
- Orgies?
- Hmm.

337
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Orgies.

338
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,840
They see sex in a different way
is what I mean.

339
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,240
But, listen, I do think
it's a very healthy thing, right?

340
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,240
Your table is ready.

341
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
- Okay. Ángeles, I gotta go.
- What?

342
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,240
Yes, uh, nice seeing you.
I had such a great time,

343
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,360
but I've just gotta... I have an emergency,
and I'm sorry. I gotta go.

344
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,200
You're fucking kidding, right? Santi!

345
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,280
What's going on? What's going on?

346
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,760
- Holy shit, Dad. What's wrong, hmm?
- Let's see.

347
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,600
No, just...

348
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,560
I heard... I heard a weird noise,
and I was worried about you, you know.

349
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,040
And your date?

350
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,880
She... she had to leave.

351
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,200
- She had a headache.
- You talked about Mom, didn't...

352
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,360
What smells so weird?

353
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,360
- You feel okay?
- Of course.

354
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,360
- What's this, huh?
- Homework.

355
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm so very proud of you, you know.

356
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
Keep studying.
Study hard, honey, study hard.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
God damn it.

Hello!

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,720
I'm here in this big house,
seeing my sister.

361
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,840
Well, well,
and who do we have here in the kitchen?

362
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,400
It's my bro-in-law.
He's made dinner for us.

363
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Don't film me.

364
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Well, he's in a bad mood
because he got fired from work.

365
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,016
- So you told her?
- Cynthia, not now.

366
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,720
Relax, I'll edit it out. It's not live.

367
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,960
- Mmm!
- What happened to your face?

368
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,400
Mm. It's a bit swollen from the treatment.

369
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,560
Yes, but you're gonna love it.
Tomorrow, baby face.

370
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,880
Hey, let me know about Tenerife
'cause I gotta give an answer.

371
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,560
- Mm.
- Are you coming with me?

372
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,680
What's this about Tenerife?

373
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,200
She's invited to stay at this hotel
this weekend. We can come.

374
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,960
- You up for it? There's a spa.
- We'll think about it.

375
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,000
- Now that you have time.
- Why did they fire you?

376
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,120
Are you going to stay here for dinner,
or are you leaving?

377
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,120
Oh.

378
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,560
She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. Come on.

379
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,040
I mean, who's gonna hire him
now because of his old age?

380
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,360
- Love you.
- Love you more.

381
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,960
Honey, I'm here.

382
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
- Hello.
- Mmm!

383
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,160

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240

An emotionally polyamorous couple

or sexually polyamorous
or romantic anarchists, poly-fidelity...

391
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,560
I want you to meet my parents.

392
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,680
What? Isn't it a bit soon?

393
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
What do you mean?

394
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,200
We've been dating for three years.
I think it's about time.

395
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,400
Yes. Well, I... okay, at the right moment.

Wanna have dinner with them tomorrow?

401
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,400
Oh, but tomorrow I wanted to take you
to this place that's amazing.

402
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,440
Didn't you say that to have an open
relationship things gotta be solid?

403
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,920
Yeah.

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,560
A relationship isn't solid
until your girlfriend bites the bullet

405
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,960
and meets her in-laws. It's the way it is.

406
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,840
Okay, well, let's see them tomorrow.

407
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
But make it early, okay? I have work.

408
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
You'll love them. Ha!

409
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,800
Good morning, my little slut.

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,240
Look what I've got.

411
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
All for you.

412
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,800

- Huh?

Your legs look longer,
because of the perspective.

Not yet, no. Not yet.

424
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Wait, Patri.
I'm gonna get changed, okay? Ow!

425
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Hmm.

426
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,520
Not working today either, sir?

No, uh, I took the week off, actually.

428

Oh, how nice. You work so hard.

429
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,560
Hey, why are you making
the maid take photos?

430
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
A photographer costs a lot, you know.

431
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Look, honey, what am I here for?

432
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,320
You serious?

433
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,960
Jesus! Careful.
You'll get yourself killed.

434
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,960
Try to look out for cars.

435
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,880
Good.

436
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,600
How's that? A bit closer.

437
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,880
- Try turning.
- Good. Come on, one more.

438
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,840
Come on, I mean,
we're not 15 years old anymore.

439
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,560
No, no, sir. This way, please.
Great. Yes, thank you.

440
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,120
Yeah, excellent angle. That's good.

441
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,120
Oh! Oops, sorry. Sorry.

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
That's it.

443
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,440
Right there. Yeah, that's amazing!

444
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,120
Hey, you!
Can't you see we're recording right now?

445
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,576
- Come on, knock it off.
- Excuse me.

446
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,000
- I asked you to... come on!
- Calm down. Whoa!

447
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
But she said take the initiative.

448
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,640
- Literally.
- And I was still sleeping.

449
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,120
- That's a kind of rape.
- Wow.

450
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,720
You said, "If you're hard, go for it."
Isn't that what you said?

451
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,040
Sex is more beautiful

452
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,560
if your partner is also conscious
during the act though.

453
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Mm-hmm.

454
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,240
Then in 24 hours,
I've gone from asexual to rapist.

455
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,160
I just don't get it.

456
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
Well, it's not that difficult.

457
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,520
You could say good morning first.
Be polite.

458
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,816
- I said, "Good morning, you little slut."
- Little slut?

459
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,160
"Look what I've got for you."

460
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,080
Look, if I don't respond,
it's because I didn't hear you, hmm?

461
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,000
You could also make me coffee,
to wake me up.

462
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,640
Well, how long do you think
an erection lasts at my age?

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,800
I don't know. You tell me.

464
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,200
I don't know. I... I give up.
I'm just... I'm just so lost right now.

465
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,640
You really fucked my date up.
Thanks, guys.

466
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,920
I hurried home in terror,

467
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,600
and Álex was sitting there studying,
like an angel.

468
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Okay, she heard you arrive,
and the boyfriend jumped out the window.

469
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
We live on the fifth floor.
What is he, Batman?

470
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,320
Ah, don't worry,
just go out again with Ángeles.

471
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
With Ángeles? No. No, guys.

472
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,880
It's the second time
I've ditched her, poor thing.

473
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,456
No fixing that.

474
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,280
Who is that? Ángeles?

475
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,080
- Pick it up.
- No, no, no, no, no.

476
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
You should answer it.

477
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,720
Turn the speaker on. Turn the...

478
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,360
I don't want to, damn it!

479
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,040
Ángeles! Ángeles. Hello!

480
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,520
I... I... I'm... I'm sor...

481
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm very sorry
about the other day, really.

482
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,160
Look, I... I...
I have to tell you that I have this tick.

483
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
And I have to check the gas stove,
and I got all anxious about that.

484
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,480
The truth is that I just couldn't...

485
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
What?

486
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,200
- What?
- Uh, okay, perfect. Yes.

487
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,400
Well, send me your address.

488
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,000
Got it, yes.

489
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,560
Okay, wonderful.

490
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,880
Okay, okay, okay.
See you soon. See you soon.

491
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
And?

492
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,360
She... she said I should come over
and stop playing games.

493
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,640
- Hell yeah!
- Santi!

494
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,280
They're gonna fix your phimosis.

495
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,800
Hey, come on, please, stop, stop.

496
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,000
Are you all gonna freak out
every time I go on a date?

497
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Yeah.

498
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,080
What should we do? We could hit the town.

499
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,520
Uh, no, no, today's impossible.
Got this thing at home that...

500
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm going to dinner with Luz.
I'm introducing her to my parents.

501
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
What?

502
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,880
They've been married for 44 years.

503
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,080
Forty-four years.
Ha! Easier said than done.

504
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,520
And they're still happy.

505
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,960
They even still have sex.
Can you believe it?

506
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,400
Thank you for the info.

507
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,280
<i>Mom!</i>

508
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,840
<i>Sweetheart! Ramón, it's our boy.</i>

509
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,160
<i>How were the empanadas? They were tuna.</i>

510
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,520
Yes, uh, delicious.

511
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,800
Hey, I'm gonna come over for dinner
to introduce you to Luz.

512
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,576
<i>- Which Luz?
- His girlfriend.</i>

513
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,760
<i>- Oh, Sol?
- That was a different one.</i>

514
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,600
- There in half an hour.
<i>- Oh, today? No! No, no, no, no, no.</i>

515
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,520
<i>- We... we can't today.</i>
- Why not?

516
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,640
- Mama.
<i>- We're going to a concert.</i>

517
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,480
<i>We're going with Aunt Alicia
and Uncle Javier</i>

518
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,840
<i>to the National Auditorium.</i>

519
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,600
But since
when do you like classical music?

520
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,480
<i>Hang up, Pili. We'll be late.</i>

521
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,840
<i>This Sunday.
Come on Sunday for stew.</i>

522
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
<i>Kisses, sweetie-pie. I love you.</i>

523
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,360
What? We're not going, huh?

524
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,440
- They're going to a concert.
- Why didn't you ask them before?

525
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
I never schedule with my parents.
They're always home.

526
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,640
Let's go. We should get a drink now.

527
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,360
But you... hey, what a beautiful marriage
they've got, huh?

528
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
- Uh-huh.
- They even go out to concerts and stuff.

529
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,440
Forty-four years.

530
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,480
- I know.
- And they hold hands in public.

531
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,680
Tricolor quinoa with mixed vegetables,

532
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,440
a stew with seitan protein

533
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,560
and eggplant pâté with crudités.

534
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,000
And for our drink, kombucha.

535
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's see. That's it. Ginger, my favorite.

536
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,800
This is all accompanied
by this marvelous cardboard flatbread,

537
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,360
which is so good.

538
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,280
Well, at least it's edible.

539
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,960
Look, really, if you don't like it,
use it to fix a wonky table instead.

540
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,840
I don't know who makes this bread.

541
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,640
However, since they're in Germany,
they won't find out.

542
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,040
Mm. I've gotta go.
My boyfriend is giving me the look.

543
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Bye.

544
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,520
- Mmm.
- We having this for dinner?

545
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,880
Or was it just for the video?

546
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,160
Patri made it for us with all her love.

547
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,840
I've worn her out reading vegan recipes.

548
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,120
Poor little thing.

549
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,080
Hey, weren't you going out
with your friends now?

550
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,520
People say that work absorbs you,
but that's a lie.

551
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,080
It's life that absorbs you.

552
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,320
- What?
- Everyone has their families now.

553
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,080
Nothing's like it was before,
when we did what we wanted.

554
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,840
Growing old really sucks.

555
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,440
Honey, I think you're in shock.

556
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,920
Don't overthink it all.

557
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,840
This one's so good. I love it.

558
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
Hey,
why are you always on your toes?

559
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,520
It makes my legs look skinny.

560
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,600
- Wow!
- And why are you laughing at the sky?

561
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,280
Well, I'm quickly getting more
and more followers, smart-ass.

562
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,800
People love my style. Is that a problem?

563
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,880
No, not at all.
As long as you're entertained.

564
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,960
Ángeles, your date's here.

565
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
How are you?

566
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,760
Uh, that's your mother, huh? Uh...

567
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,440
What's your problem, huh?

568
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,640
- Do you like teasing me or what?
- Uh, mm...

569
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,040
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

570
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,600
Uh, it's just
I haven't been honest with you.

571
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,400
What? You're married, huh?
Look, I don't care

572
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
No, no, no, no, no. I'm divorced now,
but my ex isn't really dead.

573
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,920
Okay, relax. She'll die sooner or later.

574
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,320
No, no, no. Let me say something.

575
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,840
Uh, so we split up three years ago.

576
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,320
- Because she cheated on me.
- Hmm.

577
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,760
I forgave her,
but she moved in with the other guy.

578
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,840
And even though
I truly hate her with all my soul,

579
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,640
every single day I hope she'll crawl back
and beg me to forgive her,

580
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,120
because the saddest thing of all
is that I'm still in love with her.

581
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,840
And, hmm, how does that affect us two?

582
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,600
Hmm. I don't know.
What are you looking for?

583
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,640
- An orgasm.
- Well, then that doesn't affect us.

584
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,920
Oh! Hang on. Hang on, hot shot.
Why are you in such a hurry?

585
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,640
- Eh?
- I'm gonna need some lube.

586
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,520
I think it's on my nightstand.

587
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
Oh, okay.

588
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Oh, hurry up, for God's sake!
I want you in me!

589
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,600
Got it.

590
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,800
Rub it on me, could you?

591
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,560
Uh, yes, sure.

592
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,320
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

593
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,760
- Ah, now! Ah, now! Do it now!
- Yeah, now?

594
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,680
- Oh! Ow! No! Stop, stop, stop!
- What?

595
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,960
- Oh! It stings. Oh! It stings. It stings!
- What?

596
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,136
- It's burning me! It's stinging!
- All right.

597
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
Oh, my God, fuck you.

598
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,760
Ah! Oh, holy shit, holy shit!

599
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
MOISTURIZING CREAM FOR DRY FEET

600
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,960
LUBRICANT

601
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,120
No fucking way. Oh.

602
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,720
Fuck me! A 30-euro cover charge.
Is dinner included or what?

603
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,600
Hello. Two gin and tonics, please.

604
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,120
Let's see. As you seem a bit unsure,

605
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I thought it'd be good for us to debut
our new relationship in the public arena,

606
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
the two of us.

607
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,000
Let's have a drink, see what happens.
And listen...

608
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,240
Wait a minute, wait.
Where have you brought me, Luz?

609
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,040
This is a swingers' club, darling.

610
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,240
- Swingers?
- Yes.

611
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,560
- Hey, there, son.
- What are you doing here?

612
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
Is this your girlfriend?

613
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes, Luz. Uh, hi, there.

614
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm making you a stew on Sunday.
That sounds good, huh?

615
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,040
- Yes, very much.
- Her stew is stupendous.

616
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,480
Mama, you have a... a nipple piercing.

617
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,680
For my birthday.
It was a gift from your father.

618
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,840
It got infected.
She had to take antibiotics.

619
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,600
- It was horrible.
- Oh, look.

620
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,440
Oh! We're going in the jacuzzi.
before it gets too crowded to fit in.

621
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,400
See you later.

622
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,960
- You two have fun. See you later.
- Bye, now. See you later.

623
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,320
But, uh, I thought they had a concert.

624
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,480
With my aunt and uncle.

625
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,960
Sure. Hmm.

626
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,080
Thank you.

627
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,400
Javier and Alicia. My... my aunt Alicia.

628
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Right.

629
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,600
I'm home now, Álex!

630
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,720
Álex.

631
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,840
- Yeah, be out in a second!
- Huh.

632
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,160
Nothing. Uh, my thing
with Ángeles is over, okay?

633
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,320
Body number one, that one's down.

634
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,440
Double check mark, right? Uh...

635
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,800
That's great, huh? Congratulations.

636
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Who's under there?

637
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,040
Me. I'm studying.

638
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,400
No, no. There. There. What's under there?

639
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,520
Oh, this here?
Mm, they're cushions to hold my laptop up.

640
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,160
Come out. Hey, man, out.

641
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,320
There's no problem, really. Don't worry.

642
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,560
Hmm.

643
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,480
Have a good night.

644
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,080
Well, at least they're fucking.

645
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Luz.

646
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,720
Okay, do they get a discount,
like, in museums?

647
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,600
My parents are swingers.
The world's going to hell.

648
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,960
Look, now we know
how they've kept up the passion.

649
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,160
What more proof do you need?

650
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,360
That's it. Fuck it all. Wanna get married?

651
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,600
Keep your eyes on the road!

652
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,400
It has chocolate on it
because I hid it inside that <i>coulant.</i>

653
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
But since you ordered
violet ice cream, well...

654
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,360
Raúl, you know I'm a divorce lawyer
who's also divorced.

655
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,480
- So?
- Of course not.

656
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,640
Is that what you really want?

657
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,960
No, I wanna go back to a week ago,

658
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,136
to when my girlfriend
didn't want an open relationship

659
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,280
and my mother
was a woman without piercings

660
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,440
who made empanadas with tuna.

661
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,960
Honey, I don't want you to do anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

662
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,680
Look, no, no, no, no. I'm uncomfortable.

663
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,120
I don't want anyone banging my girlfriend.
Call me a weirdo.

664
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I love you,
but I no longer believe in monogamy.

665
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,416
I don't believe in the dirty things that
those people do, people like my parents.

666
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,240
Okay, fine, now what do we do?

667
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,800
But I'm telling you
to do whatever you want to.

668
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,160
But you shouldn't say that.
You should support me, man.

669
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,880
You're not the center of the universe.

670
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,240
I think it's amazing
that you wanna be an influ...

671
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,640
Creator of content.

672
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,920
But there are millions. Millions, Daniela.
What makes you so special?

673
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,560
When you talk to me
in that condescending shitty little tone,

674
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,840
as if you were my dad,
I swear I wanna beat your ass.

675
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,760
You're the one that treats me like a fool.
"Reinvent yourself, go with the flow."

676
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,440
Here I am fixing the faucet.

677
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,816
- Taking dopey photos.
- You're the one who offered to do it.

678
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,520
And do not get me started on that trip.

679
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,280
Ah-ah! So you don't wanna go
on vacation with me?

680
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,280
- With you, yes.
- Sure.

681
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,640
But not with your sister,
Miss Treatments, God no.

682
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,640
- But yes, I'll come with you.
- Hey, listen.

683
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,481
If you're pissed because you got fired,
don't take it out on me, okay?

684
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,320
I'm not pissed, my love.
I'm reinventing myself.

685
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Go fuck yourself.

686
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
And go get unemployment.

687
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,040
Don't you worry.
I'll go to Tenerife by myself.

688
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,480
Good.

689
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,600
That look hot?

690
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,880
- Care for another margarita?
- Yes, thank you.

691
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,520
Oh, and a shot. Uh, anything.
