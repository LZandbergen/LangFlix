00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,520
Hello. My name is Santi, and I'm a sexist.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,400
Uh, my name is Luis,
and I'm also a sexist.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm Pedro, and so apparently,
I'm a sexist as well.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,280
I... my name is Raúl, and...

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,160
I don't know why I'm here.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
What's up, Raúl? Where you going?

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,000
- Hey!
- No way I'm saying this crap!

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,400
See you at the bar.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,880
- [audience murmuring]
- Now he's riled up.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,960
[chuckles]

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,040
[inhales]

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,200
Don't worry. There's always one like him.
He'll be back. You'll see.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,200
But the important thing
is you're all here.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,760
And you came here because you've decided

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
to try to break away
from patterns of toxic masculinity###masculinity:masculinidad:3.26:[sujetador, vámonos]###

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
and to move toward

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,120
a brand-new concept
of what it means to be a man.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
So from this point on,

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,160
you are male chauvinists
under deconstruction.

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200

- How did we end up here, dude?
- I have no idea.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,520
Is he writing this all down?

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,120
What was his last comment?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,880

Come on, guys! Jab, cross, jab, cross!

Jab, cross, jab, cross. All right!

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,976
- Morning.
- [man] Morning.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,480
[woman] Good morning.

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
[Pedro] José Ángel.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,160
What is this thing?

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,840
An ionizer.

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,200
It's an air purifier.
Since we can't open these windows.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,760
It's so you don't jump. [chuckles]

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
- How's it going with your...
- Oh!

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,560
Good. I'm responding to the treatment.

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,480
I might even avoid surgery
and keep the tumor as an ornament.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
I don't use it much anyway, but...

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Don't get cancer.

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,280
No, I wasn't planning on it.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,720
This shit has really
got me thinking, you know.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,280
The times are changing, Pedro.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,160
That so? Hadn't noticed at all. [scoffs]

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,120
Well, the same thing happened
with the purifier.

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
This network has always been

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,720
at the forefront of society,
not behind it.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Yeah, we're not doing too bad though.
Still on top, by a small margin.

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,320
A good executive has to know
when they've completed their cycle,

56
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,280
when to move over.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,600
José Ángel, you know I'm here
for whatever it is you need. [chuckles]

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,440
I would like you to meet someone.

59
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,560
[sighs] Hello.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,960
[José Ángel] Cristina, this is Pedro.

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
- [Cristina] Mm-hmm.
- Pedro, Cristina.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,320
- Hi there.
- Hi there.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,840
She's going to be
our new director of programming.

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
Well, I... [chuckles]

65
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,296
I would've liked to have picked the person
taking over my role. No offense, hmm?

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
None taken.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,400
If I'm the new chief executive,
I'll need to select my own team members.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
You know, in fact,
I already have a few names.

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Pedro, I'm still acting
as a chief executive.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Ah.

71
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm not following you.

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
We need a new approach
to our current schedule.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,840
A vision that's more feminine
and less patriarchal.

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
[Pedro] Uh, miss.

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,360
- Mind giving us a minute to discuss this?
- [Cristina] Yes, of course.

76
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,080
Are you firing me right now?

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
For her?

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But who... this woman? Who the hell is she?

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
What did I tell you about <i>Bad Bitch</i>?

80
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,040
I said it wasn't a good name for a comedy.

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,080
God damn, it was meant to be ironic.

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,600
People really have got
to lighten up about things, José Ángel.

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,600
You think an HIV-positive prostitute

84
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,800
with uterine cancer
is really all that funny?

85
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,800
She's looking for revenge.
It gets better over the season.

86
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
Are you really gonna fire me

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
because of a bunch of stupid,
hysterical, oversensitive ladies,

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
who turned us into a trending topic?

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,720
Ah, don't take this all so personally.

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,120
It's a corporate decision.

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,280
All of our managerial positions
are filled by men.

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
Coincidental.

93
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
No, women are calling it
the glass ceiling.

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
Have you been screwing her?

95
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,520
See? That's the type
of comment we're trying to avoid.

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,680
José Ángel,
I've just bought a brand-new house

97
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,520
with five bedrooms en suite.

98
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,360
- A wine cellar.
- [chuckles] Great, I can't wait to see it.

99
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,320
[Pedro] Yeah, right.

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,720
This Sunday I'm having a barbecue
to celebrate that I'm out of a job now.

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,720
Now, there won't be any issues
with your severance payment.

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,640
I have personally made sure the financial
office won't argue over a single euro.

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
[Pedro] All right.

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,200
Good luck.

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,080
Because the magic's leaving with me.

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
- [exhales]
- [Pedro] The magic.

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
And this whiteboard that I bought myself.

108
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,520
I'll leave it 'cause I biked here.

109
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
But I'm taking it tomorrow.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,480

[Santi] <i>Hello, good evening.</i>

113
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,960
Uh, someone is in my place,
or... or I don't...

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,560
They broke in. They're in the shower
not to leave any prints.

115
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
There's... oh, whoa!
God, honey, you really freaked me out.

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,736
- God, why are you here?
- I can't stand my mom.

117
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
Who's in the shower?

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,200
But, Dad, no one's here.

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Why you leave the water on?
I thought I told you not to waste it.

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,920
It takes forever for the water to warm up.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,680
- Hmm. I'll come live with you.
- What's that?

122
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,520
- [cell phone ringing]
- [daughter] Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
What?

124
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
Uh, you gotta go back home now, Álex.

125
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,400
When can I start making decisions
about life?

126
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
When you stop putting mine
at risk, thanks.

127
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
[sighs] She's a pain in my ass.

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,120
- Blanca.
- [Blanca] <i>You've kidnapped my daughter.</i>

129
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
[telephone ringing]

130
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
Excuse me, one second.
Please, Blanca, one second.

131
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,680
<i>- I'm calling the cops.</i>
- Oh, God.

132
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,480
<i>Give me back my daughter.</i>

133
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,480
Is she down there?

134
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,920
No. Álex, Álex. No, don't. Álex!

135
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
Mom, just let me live my life!

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
Honey, you all right?

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,280
Oh, shit.

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
[screams]

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,520
He assaulted me.
He assaulted me. They saw you.

140
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,880
[Santi] It was an accident.

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,080
The maids put the plants
outside to water them.

142
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
Bring her down now
or I'll call the cops on you.

143
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,400
- [Santi] Please, Álex, go down.
- Uh-uh.

144
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
[Santi sighs]

145
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,120
Uh, Blanca, I'll come down, but only
if we can have a civilized talk, okay?

146
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Bathed and tucked in into bed at 9:02.

147
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
I read them <i>Super Inquisitive Kids</i>
7 times before they finally passed out.

148
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
Almost fell asleep with them.

149
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
[wife] Hello.

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Do you like it?

151
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,240
[chuckles] Yeah, you look amazing.

152
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,680
Three euros on AliExpress.

153
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,760
But you can rip it off me.

154
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,760
Uh, honey, I'm kind of tired, okay?

155
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,600
- I've been breaking up street parties.
- I can do all the work.

156
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,160
[Luis sighs, groans]

157
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,360
- [wife moaning]
- [grunting]

158
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,880
- [moaning continues]
- [Luis sighs]

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,160
- Luis.
- Hmm?

160
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
- Are you sleeping now?
- No.

161
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,840
Hey, listen. I'm tired too, okay?

162
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,816
- Okay, then let's go to sleep now.
- No, no sleeping now. We need to talk.

163
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,560
- What happened here?
- This again?

164
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,800
Come on, please tell me
that you're cheating on me.

165
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,440
If not, it means I married an amoeba.

166
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm not cheating on you.
What are you saying?

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,720
- Luis, how long since we had sex?
- I don't know.

168
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,320
Five whole months!

169
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,280
Should I resign myself to the fact that
our most intimate act is doing taxes?

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
No, I know we've gotta have sex.
Of course we do.

171
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,880
When it's natural. Go with the flow.

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,400
But nothing's flowing, sweetheart.
Not at all.

173
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,560
But if you pressure me...

174
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,480
Nadal can't perform
when he's under pressure.

175
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Luis, our sex life is dead.
Just admit it. Admit it!

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Where are you going?

177
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm taking this shit off. Itchy!

178
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,080
- Shh! The kids.
- [door slams shut]

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,880
[exhales]

180
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,536
Where have you been? You should
tell me if you're not coming home.

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
Uh, honey,
I just spent the night in a jail cell.

182
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,520
See? I told you Mom's unbearable.
Oh! Look.

183
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
[Santi] Oh, who's that?

184
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
Marina. You just matched on Tinder.

185
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Oh, no, I don't have Tinder.
I don't use that.

186
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
Now you do. You got a better photo?
Here you look kinda old.

187
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,240
What? No. No, no, no, no, honey.

188
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,440
No, no.
Oh, no, take me off that right now, okay?

189
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm just fine being single.

190
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,640
[Álex] Your browser history
says otherwise.

191
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Big tits, interracial. Hmm?

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,680
[clears throat] And why are you
on my computer, hmm?

193
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,840
I should be the one monitoring you.

194
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
Dad, grief period's over.
Get back on the market now.

195
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm here to help you.
I can be your manager.

196
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,160
- Hell no!
- [cell phone chimes]

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,760
[Álex gasps] Another match!
Wow, she's cute.

198
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,920
[chuckles]

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm not going out with anyone.

200
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Hello, Ángeles. Dinner tomorrow?

201
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,480
Let's go. [laughs]

202
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
[sighs] What are you doing?

203
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,121
Supposed to be at yoga. If I'm
not more flexible, he won't believe me.

204
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
[Raúl] Hmm.

205
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
[woman sighs]

206
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,560
- [Raúl] Do you like it?
- [chuckles]

207
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
You're too late, darling.

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,400
[laughs] I'm gonna ask Luz to marry me.

209
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,560
How come?

210
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Well, to be happy,
and I don't know, to evolve in life.

211
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,920
[sighs] I feel kind of sad for her,
the poor little thing.

212
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Poor little thing, why?

213
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,320
Excuse me? [chuckles]

214
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
This doesn't count though.

215
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
When you go down the aisle,
you reset the score.

216
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
Like when you get baptized.

217
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,120
[sighs] You're so old-fashioned.

218
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
Carmen, we're gonna
have to stop doing this.

219
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,400
Sure. Pass me my bra, would you?

220
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,240
Preventative detention.
Can you believe that?

221
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Let's go. It's our serve.

222
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,240
She makes this huge scene
outside my apartment.

223
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
She calls the cops,
and I'm the one who goes to jail, man.

224
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,120
These days, if you got a dick,
you're a monster.

225
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,656
- This is serious stuff I'm telling you.
- Fifteen-love! [laughs]

226
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,520
- [Pedro] Hey, we weren't even ready.
- Go talk at the bar, you gossips.

227
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,240
I really envy you, man.
You got a girl who adores you,

228
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,680
a fucking amazing job,
an awesome new house.

229
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,200
- It looks pretty fucking awesome.
- Thirty-love! [laughs]

230
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,920
Santi, we've all got our problems,
all right?

231
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
Yeah, but how come you're doing great
and not me?

232
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,080
I don't think
you're that much smarter than I am.

233
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,720
- [Raúl] Forty-love!
- Gettin' bored.

234
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,360
Okay, come on, come on! Shut up now.

235
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
Fine, fine, fine, fine. Sorry, go.

236
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,520
- Ow!
- [groaning]

237
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,280
That's 40-15.

238
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Come on, dude.

239
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
[Santi] Aw, shit.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Quit? Weren't you getting promoted?

241
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,440
Yes, but they wouldn't let me create
my own team, so screw 'em all.

242
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,760
And... and how are you gonna...
I mean, how are we gonna pay for this all?

243
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Honey, it's not like the end of the world.

244
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,256
They told me they're gonna give me
a huge severance payment.

245
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,240
No, no, no. I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about me.

246
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,160
I really let my guard down.

247
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
Look, come on.
You'll eventually come out of furlough.

248
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Or not. If they're retiring airplanes,

249
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
they're... they're gonna retire
flight attendants too.

250
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,680
- I'm canceling the housewarming dinner.
- No, no. [chuckles]

251
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,200
We're not canceling anything.

252
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,560
So let's open a nice bottle.
Let's watch a movie and relax, come on.

253
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,000
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Pick out something good.

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,520
I'll open the wine now.
Maybe I'll even open a magnum.

255
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
Are you okay, baby?

256
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,680
Me? Great. Can't you see I'm happy?

257
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,600
Ha. Stepping outside your comfort zone
can stimulate your creativity.

258
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Where is the goddamn bottle opener?

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, and here I was
playing the soccer star's wife.

260
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,960
That's bad, Daniela, very bad. That's bad.

261
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,960
[Pedro] Sweetheart.

262
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,360
No, I'd... I'd feel better
if I could help you out.

263
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,440
You do the wine, okay?
And I'll pick out the movie.

264
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
[both sigh]

265
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,240
[woman on screen gasps]
<i>Elena's in the Kingdom...</i>

266
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,640
We can always sell the Mini.
We don't really need two cars.

267
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,760
[girl] <i>Mom?</i>

268
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
[screams]

269
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
[Daniela] Hmm?

270
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,400
- Bathed and finally in bed at 10:57.
- [chuckles]

271
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,240
- [Luis] Here.
- What's that?

272
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
A little something.

273
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
To make up
for that dumb argument the other day.

274
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,680
Oh, how nice of you.
What is this, my love?

275
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
[rattles]

276
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
[Luis grunts]

277
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,440
It's enormous, Luis.

278
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,680
Uh, my love, if you're tense,
it's not gonna work. Hmm?

279
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
- A bit lower. Come on.
- It won't fit, I'm telling you. [shouts]

280
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,080
- [moaning]
- It's in. It's in there. Okay?

281
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,000
- [clicks]
- [whirring]

282
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,480
How is it?

283
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know.

284
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
It... it feels weird though...

285
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
- What about now?
- [gasps]

286
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh, no. Turn it off, turn it off!
Okay, why do people do this?

287
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
Turn it off, fuck's sake!
What are you doing?

288
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,280
It's got one button.
It's a minimalist thing.

289
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,520
God, get it out of me now!

290
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,376
Are you sure? You'll get used to it.
I'm supposed to penetrate you now.

291
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,560
- Luis, get that outta my ass now.
- Shit. Okay, okay.

292
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,320
- [grunts, groans]
- Carefully, goddamn it!

293
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,640
Uh, my love,

294
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,480
if you squeeze your sphincter,
it won't move. Hmm?

295
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,160
- [girl] Mommy.
- [gasps] What's up, sweetie?

296
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
[girl] Mommy, I'm scared.

297
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,280
What's wrong, hon? Have a nightmare?

298
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,520
No, I did.

299
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,520
But he told me about it,
and now I can't sleep.

300
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,400
Kids, this has gotta stop, okay?
Same thing every night.

301
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
[groans] Come on, kids, back to bed.

302
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,760
Not you. I want Mama.

303
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,360
[whirring continues]

304
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
[whirring continues]

305
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Someone's calling you.

306
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes, I'll answer in a sec, hon.

307
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,160
- [button clicks]
- [whirring grows louder]

308
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
Wouldn't you rather put it in the soup?
Get it over with and then eat in peace?

309
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,200
No, put it in the <i>coulant.</i>
It's our favorite dessert.

310
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,960
Give it to her out of the box and keep it.

311
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,000
- Who's the one proposing here?
- You, you.

312
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,496
[laughs] With that eye out there,
you look kind of ridiculous.

313
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
- Huh?
- [groans]

314
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,216
- [woman] Hi, baby.
- [Raúl] Hey! How are you?

315
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,280
[sighs] Oh, just fed up
with these meetings.

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
Ooh! You get hit with a racket?

317
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
You look beautiful.

318
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
You as well.

319
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
[chuckles] Alcohol, please. Some alcohol.

320
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,920
[Raúl] <i>Happy anniversary.</i>

321
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,960
Three years already, my God.

322
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,640
- My personal record. [chuckles]
- Mmm! Mm.

323
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,520
[smacks lips]
When I first met you, I thought,

324
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,440
"Where... where did this moron escape from?"

325
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,840
It was love at first sight.

326
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
Luz, I feel like
the luckiest guy in the world.

327
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,880
You are the sexiest and smartest woman
I've ever met in my life.

328
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
The <i>coulant</i> for the couple here.

329
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,000
- [plate clatters]
- [Luz] Oh, no.

330
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,440
I'd prefer some violet sherbet.
In honor of your eye there.

331
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,200
Uh, but that's your favorite.

332
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,720
Yeah, I'd prefer this though.

333
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
Yeah, but the cake also has ice cream.
Look, look.

334
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,480
Raúl, that's vanilla ice cream.
I want violet sherbet.

335
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,880
Okay, I'll eat the cake then.
Bring her the sherbet.

336
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,640
[Luz] Hey, so tell me.

337
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,360
Do I turn you on, like at the beginning,
or is something missing?

338
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,960
- [Raúl] Why are you asking?
- Tell me.

339
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Yes, yes.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,760
Come on, I still get so turned on by you.

341
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,920
I don't get it.
What's there for me to miss?

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,320
I spend every day with couples

343
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,640
who are destroyed
by boring routines, you know.

344
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,560
- But we still love each other, huh?
- Totally.

345
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Okay, so that's why I wanted
to use this evening to propose something

346
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,520
a little crazy.

347
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
[laughs] You gotta be kidding.

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
[Luz] You want an open relationship?

349
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
What?

350
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,040
And your violet sherbet.

351
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,280
Looks delicious, eh?
But that cake looks great too.

352
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,680
[Luz] Thank you, honey.

353
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,200
What do you mean? What are you saying?

354
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,120
So we can try sleeping with other people.

355
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,336
For the past three years, you've
never wanted to sleep with anyone else?

356
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,200
No way, never.

357
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,440
Raúl, I adore you,
but monogamy is unsustainable.

358
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,720
People get bored. They get frustrated.
They cheat, and everything goes to hell.

359
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,680
But I don't understand at all.

360
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,160
'Cause we're good.
Because we <i>are </i>good, right?

361
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
Of course. But you should open
things up when it's going well.

362
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,360
Otherwise, you'll just ruin it all.

363
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,120
But, like, you just asked
for permission to fuck other guys.

364
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,600
No, I'm saying that I don't
want us to fall victim to monotony.

365
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,720
Hmm? You mean too much to me.

366
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Look, I feel like I'm hearing
contradictory things here.

367
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Hey, if you're not ready to have
an open relationship, I understand.

368
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,840
But tell me straight,
because I'd rather we broke up now.

369
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,560
- And then we can stay friends.
- Oh, this is an ultimatum?

370
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,320
I'm 42 years old. And I want it all.

371
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,680
I want the warmth of home life
and the warmth of another guy. Hmm?

372
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
I don't wanna be dishonest.

373
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,960
Can I think this over a little?

374
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,360
Sure, my love.

375
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,720
Whew! I've said it now.
I was pretty nervous. [chuckles]

376
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
- Look, see? Now I'd like some <i>coulant.</i>
- No, no.

377
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,040
You wanted violet sherbet, right?

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,440
Well, eat it up. It's melting.

379
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,480
- Okay, but just a little.
- No, no.

380
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,920
The <i>coulant</i> is mine.

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,560
- [Luz] Just a little bit.
- [Raúl] Hey.

382
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,800
- [beeping]
- [Pedro sighs]

And downward-facing dog.
Very good, ladies.

391
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,160
As we connect our minds and our bodies

392
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,920
and feel deep gratitude.

393
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,200
Be thankful, just like in church,
but no one's forcing you, okay? Now relax...

394
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,080
- What is this?
- Eh?

395
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,640
Hmm? Taking advantage of this
beautiful sunrise to post on Instagram.

396
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,560
I couldn't sleep.

397
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,760
You're serious? [scoffs]

398
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,360
Cynthia got paid 2,000 euros to post
a photo of herself drinking kombucha.

399
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,920
Uh, Cynthia does have half a million,
uh, followers. You got 500.

400
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,600
- Well, you gotta start somewhere.
- Start what?

401
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,520
Oh, Pedro, making money, darling.
I have to earn a living.

402
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,280
Oh, quick! Quick, take a photo. Hurry!

403
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,880
- Hurry up, Pedro, come on!
- All right, all right.

404
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,320
[Daniela] Let's see. Ah! Oh! Ah!

405
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,120
Vertically, for Christ's sake.
You'll cut my legs off.

406
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,816
- You get it? You get it?
- [camera shutter clicking]

407
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,240
Okay, very good, that's it. You get it?

408
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,800
Uh, it's still on selfie mode.

409
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,880
- It's just me.
- [Daniela] Please. God, you look so ugly.

Okay, great, take a breather!

415
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Break now!

00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160

420
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,000
Luz, I'm here because we're old friends,

421
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,200
and I know that you would never ever side
with such a shitty man.

422
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,560
[Luz] Blanca, I'm here as a mediator,
as always.

423
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,120
The agreement says she lives with me.
That's final.

424
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,640
At that time, Álex's opinion wasn't taken
into account, but now she's 16 years old.

425
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,080
I wanna live with my father.

426
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,960
He's giving her drugs to make her hate me.

427
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,920
Well, maybe I'm the one
who wants full custody now.

428
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
What's wrong?
One night in jail wasn't enough, huh?

429
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Blanca, be reasonable.

430
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,720
You're all against me. All right.

431
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,360
See you all in court.

432
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,480
If Álex testifies
and the judge gives Santi custody,

433
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
he'll also most likely
get the family home back as well.

434
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,840
- Oh, you wanna put me out on the street?
- Uh, no.

435
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,880
I didn't say anything,
but, um, if I can go back home now, I...

Yes, yes, that's what I heard from Ulises.

It was, well, a bit awkward,
to tell you the truth.

We have a strict child protection policy
at this school.

In the bathroom, I washed it.

And I fully understand that kids' parents
might have these toys at home.

- What do you fully understand, Erika?

squeeze in a pitiful fuck.

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
Is that asshole still bothering you?

499
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Uh, well, my kid signed me up for Tinder,

500
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,320
and, well, she matched me
with someone who keeps messaging.

501
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
- [all] Ooh!
- All right, go, Santi!

502
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,640
- Well, this is historical. [laughs]
- Okay, come on, let's see.

503
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
- No, no!
- Let's see. Let's see, let's see.

504
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
[Santi sighs]

505
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,520
[exhales] Santiago.

506
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,480
[Raúl] Well,
I think she's a very fuckable MILF.

507
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Of course that's the first thing
you say about her.

508
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,016
- [wife] We're exactly the same.
- No.

509
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
- [Luis] Honey.
- What?

510
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
- Easy.
- [Daniela] Hey, invite her over.

511
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,040
Who, her?
Oh, no, I haven't even met her yet.

512
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,120
- Yeah, so she can see you have friends!
- No, Raúl, no. Damn it, Raúl, no!

513
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
- Let him go.
- [laughing]

514
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
[Daniela] Santi's on Tinder, wow!

515
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,120
- And you're an influencer, ooh!
- Oh, no, I'm a content creator, thank you.

516
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,600
Hmm. What kind of content?

517
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,536
- [Pedro] Lifestyle by Daniela.
- [Daniela] Hmm.

518
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,120
Healthy food, mindfulness, decoration.

519
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,680
Whatever stupid stuff comes to mind.

520
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,960
What do you know about that?

521
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Stupid stuff? A lot.

522
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,896
[Pedro] Well, I really have to say,
she's made the most of the furlough.

523
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,440
She's got degrees in design, nutrition,
oh, and a doctorate in psychology.

524
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,240
Why don't we talk about your promotion?

525
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,280
[Santi] A promotion?
You're kidding me, Pedro.

526
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
- Ángeles is coming now.
- What?

527
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,000
She's desperate.
She's perfect for you. [laughing]

528
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,816
All right, let's make a toast,
'cause Pedro's the new chief executive.

529
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,800
Santi's getting laid
for the first time in years.

530
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,200
- [Daniela] Lean over, Santi. Move.
- [laughing]

531
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,520
- [Luis] Mm.
- [sighs] Gotta pee. Bathroom?

532
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,816
- [Daniela] To the left of the front door.
- [wife groans]

533
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,080
- How many are there?
- Six.

534
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,480
- [wife groans] Fuck me.
- [Luis] Want me to come with you?

535
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Leave me alone.

536
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
[gasps]

537
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,600
[cell phone chimes]

538
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,480
That's great, right, Santi?

539
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,080
How exciting to get back
on the dating scene after a long time.

540
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,240
There's the flirting,
the nervousness, the novelty...

541
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,120
Hell no. The best thing in the world
is having someone beside you

542
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,240
who loves you,
respects you, understands you.

543
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,080
[Santi] Look,
I don't wanna be with anyone.

544
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,280
In fact, I think I'll cancel our date.
I'd rather not.

545
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,520
Santi, you don't have to cling
onto the patriarchal model of monogamy.

546
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
[wife] It fucking sucks!

547
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
Okay, I'd been waiting
for someone to say that.

548
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
To say what?

549
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,720
Suddenly everything is patriarchal.
It's like we're a virus.

550
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,880
I feel like there's a war
on the Y chromosome now.

551
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,480
It's a defective chromosome.
Even the biologists are saying so.

552
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Oh, yeah? So why do you wanna be like us?

553
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,680
No, no, no. Don't confuse things.
All we want is equality.

554
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
Are female soccer players
paid the same as Messi?

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
- That isn't sexism. It's marketing.
- It's a patriarchal market.

556
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,920
- I'm a big fan of women's soccer.
- Because you're a pervert, honey.

557
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,280
Well, too bad, Raúl, too bad.

558
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,320
Now we gotta cry.
We're all supposed to show our emotions.

559
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,720
[Luz] You're just scared shitless

560
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,600
your perfect world
is crashing down around you.

561
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Esther, are you okay?

562
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,936
- [Luz] We see fear in your eyes.
- [Santi] You send this?

563
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,080
Why'd you say that, dude?

564
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,440
- [Raúl] What?
- Esther.

565
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,680
- [Raúl] Is she coming or not?
- Shh! Here, come here. [gasps]

566
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,560
- Esther.
- Shh! Come, come.

567
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,656
- Check out this closet.
- [Luis] What are you doing?

568
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
It's bigger than our whole bedroom.

569
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,040
But, hey, some of us get
to marry a television mogul

570
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
and have a hot body too,

571
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,800
and some of us marry a cop.

572
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,816
- And look like me. [chuckles]
- Sure, honey, yeah.

573
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,496
- What are you doing?
- Let's do it in here.

574
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,480
And most important,
never objectify a woman at all.

575
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,240
Even though they objectify themselves.

576
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,360
Oh, Daddy doesn't like
his little girl in a bikini?

577
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,520
Look, things are changing,
and if you don't like it, fuck off.

578
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
[Daniela] Exactly.

579
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Is he mad?

580
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
You don't even need to come.

581
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,560
- Come on, let's go back downstairs.
- [laughing] Come on.

582
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,720
I'll even let you
pretend that I'm Daniela.

583
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,920
But, you... no, no, no.
But, Esther, you're too drunk right now.

584
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
Put your panties back on,
or you're gonna lose 'em.

585
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,520
[sighs]

586
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,960
What a loser, my God. [sighs]

587
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,080
Pedro, did I piss you off?
Is it what we were talking about?

588
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,880
- [guests chattering]
- [sighs]

589
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,760
I got fired from work, Luz.

590
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,000
What?

591
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
[Pedro] I told Daniela that I quit,
but I...

592
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,920
They gave my job to a woman.

593
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,880
[groans] Holy shit. I'm so sorry.

594
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,000
The glass ceiling has smashed
and fallen on my head.

595
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,880
I'm sorry.

596
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,640
We're in a bad mood, and now she's coming.
What's wrong with you?

597
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
- Really, why the hell did you do that?
- What is this?

598
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,280
What? Nothing.
Clearing up. Coffee, anyone?

599
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,400
You're serious? With my best friend?

600
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,216
- [Luz] Raúl, please.
- He's your best friend?

601
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,360
As if I'd do anything with Pedro. [scoffs]

602
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,776
- Why are you hugging?
- [Luz] Well, he got fired from work.

603
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,040
I guess you guys don't talk about things.

604
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,760
- What?
- [Esther] My husband is asexual!

605
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,136
- [Luis] Esther!
- [doorbell rings]

606
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,720
[Santi] Oh, shit, I'll go. I'll go.

607
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,120
Uh, which way's the front door?
Front door? Here?

608
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
Over here.

609
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,400
- [Ángeles] Santi?
- Hey, Ángeles. What's up?

610
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,080
Well, well,
what a beautiful house you got.

611
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,176
- It's not mine. It's my friend's home.
- [laughing]

612
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,256
I did the valuation.
I valued it a little bit higher.

613
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,880
[Raúl] You're having an affair.
That's why he told you and not me.

614
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,000
- What'd you say, dumbass?
- Exactly what you heard.

615
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,280
[Daniela] Do you think it's normal
to tell her before me?

616
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,040
What kind of fucking relationship is this?

617
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,200
Uh... [chuckles]

618
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,080
Um, uh... [clears throat]

619
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,576
- Wanna come in or...
- [Esther] Fuck!

620
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,280
- I just wanna fuck!
- [Ángeles] Oh, wow...

621
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,120
[groans] Come down here
and drink some coffee.

622
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,960
Hmm, if you want...

623
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,576
- We could take a rain check.
- Much better. I'm so sorry, really.

624
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,960
- Bye.
- [Ángeles chuckles]

625
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,720
Uh-huh.

626
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,320
- [retching]
- [Luz] Okay, it's all right.

627
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,680
- Get it all out, good.
- [Esther sobs, spits]

628
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,920
Come on, honey, that's it.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

629
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,800
- [Esther spits, groans]
- Thank you.

630
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,040
- [Esther coughs, sobs]
- Wipe your mouth.

631
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,280
[lighter clicks]

632
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,160
- You're the one who left her.
- Yes.

633
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,920
[Pedro] Raúl, let me make something clear.

634
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,920
I would never sleep with Luz, hmm?
That is sacred.

635
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,800
I know. I wouldn't with Daniela either.

636
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,560
[laughs] No way in hell.

637
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
[laughing]

638
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,400
You had me worried, bud.

639
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,040
And why won't you screw your wife?

640
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
I do fu...

641
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,840
Come on, it's a rough patch.

642
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
[Pedro scoffs]

643
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,880
Hey, if you wanna swim, now's your chance.

644
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,760
Don't know how much longer
I can pay for this.

645
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,600
[sighs] Come on, let's go.

646
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,120
A bit of fun, let's go.

647
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,760
[shouts]

648
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,440
[gasps] Oh, fuck.

649
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,960
Oh, my God!
You don't heat this thing, why?

650
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,640
[laughing] Another margarita?

651
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,760
Uh, not me. I'm too drunk.
I'll have some water.

652
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
- [grunts]
- [Luis] Hey!

653
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,560
We're too old for this, man.

654
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,200
Now you're all supposed to jump in
so we can have fun as a group.

655
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,360
- [Santi] Yeah, we'll be right back, man.
- [laughing]

656
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,080
Bring me a towel, you fucking bastards.

657
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,056
- [laughs]
- [Luis] You've got this big-ass house.

658
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,320
But the water's freezing.

659
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,560
