1
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:07,963
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:08,963
Léa.

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:12,363
Do you think what happened is normal?

4
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:34,723
Honestly.

5
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:36,923
I'm really sorry, Mr. Blanchard.

6
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,203
Please forgive me. I…

7
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:43,323
My ex is coming with a plus-one,
but I don't know who it is, so I…

8
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:44,843
You know… I need to…

9
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:48,083
I'm obsessed.
I don't know who that plus-one is.

10
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:50,003
Right, I'll…

11
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:51,723
I'll get it together.

12
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:59,403
Léa, I do like you, you do good work,
but your detox thing…

13
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:00,323
What?

14
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:02,923
Sven told me.

15
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:06,043
You know how he is. Blunt.

16
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:11,523
This may come as a shock to you.

17
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,203
But I know what it's like.

18
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:16,123
I've had addiction problems myself.

19
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:18,803
With stamps.

20
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,083
Oh, really? Wow!

21
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:22,883
Must have been hard.

22
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:25,243
Very. And you can't do it alone.

23
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,523
So I'm giving you a second chance.

24
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:36,723
My niece has created
this digital detox center.###center:centre:5.39:[raison, minutes]###

25
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:37,683
Right.

26
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,363
You are registered for this weekend.

27
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:42,443
The cure or the door.###door:porte:5.47:[exemple, plan]###

28
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,483
-Understood?
-Completely.

29
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,723
I choose the cure. Not the door.###door:porte:5.47:[droit, choses]###

30
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:55,763
Mom?###Mom:maman:4.74:[week, génie]###

31
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:06,403
-Hi, honey! How are you?
-Hi, Mom.

32
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,963
It's 11. You're right on time for a toast.

33
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:10,683
No, thanks.

34
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,242
Too bad for you. It's really good.

35
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,163
So you came for Julien's thesis?

36
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,683
The nerd in the family must be celebrated.###family:famille:5.52:[service, mère]###

37
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:21,963
Yes, right.

38
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:25,043
You closed the restaurant on a Friday,
which you never do.

39
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:29,283
You took a plane to come to Paris
to listen to, let me quote…###plane:avion:4.86:[valeurs, euros]###

40
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:33,323
"Stentoplasty
in the treatment of traumatic thoracic

41
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,643
and lumbar vertebral factures."

42
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,523
Exactly. This is both fun and fascinating.

43
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:40,683
Sure.

44
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,923
Mom?###Mom:maman:4.74:[traitement, américaine]###

45
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:46,803
I know you.

46
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:54,203
I told you that
that music career was bullshit.###music:musique:5.26:[octobre, chambre]###

47
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:57,163
So I bought you a plane ticket
to Corsica in three days###days:jours:5.65:[sais, vraiment]###

48
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,443
and it will help you forget your problems!

49
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:04,323
It's going to be great. You'll see!

50
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:06,763
We'll get our habits back.###habits:habitude:4.83:[téléphone, petits-enfants]###

51
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:10,403
Ange at the bar, us in the dining area.
We'll have a new menu.

52
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,923
And I'll buy you a microphone
with glitter, so you sing karaoke.

53
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:17,123
-It will be great, baby. I can't wait.
-Hold on.

54
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:19,883
I'm excited.

55
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,483
Listen to me.
You want to ruin your career? Fine.

56
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,603
But give me back the 5,000 euros
you borrowed.

57
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:27,963
-Got it?
-Yes.

58
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:30,163
-You have 'til tonight.
-Yes, you'll get it.

59
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,283
Who was it?

60
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:36,403
That was Cynthia.

61
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,443
The old lady from upstairs.
She lost her cat again, whatever.###cat:chat:4.76:[vendredi, hauteur]###

62
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:44,403
So I just thought of something
that I need to do.

63
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:47,763
Let's meet for Julien's thesis.

64
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:48,763
Okay?

65
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:50,443
I wanted to go with you.

66
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:52,523
You'll have to go on your own.

67
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:54,723
-Okay? Love you.
-Love you.

68
00:03:55,843 --> 00:04:00,283
You'll end up in rehab, alone and chubby.
Just like Drew Barrymore.

69
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:05,923
I'm sure it's just a buddy.
I don't know what I imagined.

70
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:07,403
He invited his girlfriend!

71
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,843
I'm sure she's hot and you'll want to die!

72
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:12,603
-You know me, I'm blunt!
-So I shouldn't go?

73
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:15,603
You have to go!

74
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,843
And pretend that you have moved on.

75
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,883
-All right.
-But not with that face.

76
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:20,883
No.

77
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:23,163
He must have blood in his eyes
when he sees you so pretty.###eyes:yeux:5.31:[octobre, chambre]###

78
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,603
-Yes. Okay.
-Okay?

79
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:25,723
-You believe it.
-Yes.

80
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:26,923
-You're a winner.
-Yes?

81
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:27,843
-Yes?
-Yes.

82
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:28,923
-Yes.
-Yes.

83
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,163
-Yes who?
-Yes, sir.

84
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,923
It's crazy how I can my find my way
without a phone.

85
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,803
-Eiffel Tower, over there.
-Yes?

86
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,523
-Montmartre, over there.
-Yes?

87
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:41,683
-Medical school, straight ahead.
-GPS says back here.

88
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:44,283
So please, follow me.
I don't have all day.###day:jour:5.75:[toi, sais]###

89
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,443
What's with that dress? It's not Cannes!###dress:robe:4.59:[écran, papa]###

90
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,443
-Come on!
-What?

91
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,163
Is it too much?

92
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:51,443
-Come!
-Tell me!

93
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:52,723
Wait up.

94
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:54,723
Be happy I'm here to help.

95
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:57,243
Is it because of the glitter?

96
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:58,523
What?

97
00:04:58,603 --> 00:04:59,843
Thank you for coming.

98
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,963
I'm so proud of you.

99
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:03,323
I'm really stressed.

100
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,203
-Did you see Audrey?
-Yes, but careful with the baby carrier,###baby:bébé:4.81:[croix, prends]###

101
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:09,563
Pablo might get bowed legs,
just like Don Diego de la Mancha.###legs:jambes:4.51:[stress, restaurant]###

102
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,203
Right, thank you, Mireille.
I'm fine and you?

103
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,203
-Good for you.
-Right.

104
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,043
Congrats.

105
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,123
-You came?
-I did.

106
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,523
I've been thinking about your bedroom.###bedroom:chambre:5.24:[dessus, études]###

107
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:24,763
Nico is right, green is better.

108
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,003
-See?
-Totally.

109
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,643
-How are you, sis?
-Here comes Léa.

110
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,723
Is that the grocer from down the street?

111
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:36,843
How handsome.

112
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:40,923
-What the…
-You didn't say we had to dress up.

113
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:43,123
-What's that dress?
-I don't know.###dress:robe:4.59:[portable, génie]###

114
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,603
Fuck! People will stare at her now.

115
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:46,963
-How are you?
-Good.

116
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,203
Hi.

117
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:52,723
Gagan, here is Mireille, my mother.###mother:mère:5.45:[raison, dessus]###

118
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:53,923
Hi, ma'am.###ma'am:madame:4.81:[perte, prête]###

119
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:54,923
Hi.

120
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:56,603
We could have worn our suits.###suits:costumes:4.01:[lourde, tatouage]###

121
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,363
It was the opportunity to wear them.

122
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:04,483
Mom, here is Gagan, my boyfriend.###Mom:maman:4.74:[perte, voulais]###

123
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,403
-Fuck!
-Nice to meet you, Gogen.

124
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,363
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

125
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:16,283
I hope you're staying
for the celebration afterward.

126
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:17,323
Are you?

127
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:20,123
Of course!

128
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,203
-I cooked and everything.
-Wouldn't miss it.

129
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:24,763
Amazing.

130
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,243
You suck, like a lot.

131
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:30,283
This is amazing. I'm so happy for you.

132
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:33,443
Should I cancel your appointment
to freeze your eggs?###appointment:rendez-vous:4.92:[données, voulais]###

133
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,803
-You wanted to freeze my eggs?
-Yes, not mine, silly.

134
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,763
I'm desperate.

135
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,163
They shame me in Orléans.

136
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:43,003
Do you know that all your friends
from high school have kids?

137
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,123
I had to do something. Let's go.

138
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:48,483
I'm sorry. Where is your name from?

139
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:50,883
The USA. My mom was born in Baltimore.

140
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:54,043
Interesting.
On Google, they say it's Indian.

141
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,403
"Happy who was able to know
the causes of things."###things:choses:5.47:[peux, merci]###

142
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,723
Correct.

143
00:06:58,803 --> 00:06:59,883
Who's that from?

144
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:02,803
-Virgil.
-Virgil?

145
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,323
Virgil.

146
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:08,403
"Virgil, born around October 15th BC,
under the reign of Augustus."

147
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:11,403
I saw a remarkable documentary
about this emperor and his fellows.###emperor:empereur:4.54:[restaurant, génération]###

148
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:14,123
-Yes?
-They used to sodomize each other.

149
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,603
-What?
-Yes, look.

150
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:19,723
-I've seen it.
-Look!

151
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:21,083
These are the bas-relief.

152
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:23,363
-Léa? Please.
-Yes?

153
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,603
-Sorry.
-I need to talk to you.

154
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:27,483
I'm so sorry.

155
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:28,683
I panicked.

156
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,043
Please stay. Stay here with me.

157
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:34,523
-Fine, but it will cost you.
-Okay. Got it.

158
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,843
Wait up. I'll be right back. Julien?

159
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:37,883
So…

160
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,083
Is Guillaume not coming?

161
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:41,083
He's late. What's that dress?###dress:robe:4.59:[infos, bar]###

162
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:44,683
This? It's for Gagan.
He likes it when I'm feminine.

163
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,803
You know what I like?

164
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,043
When you behave. I'm not kidding.

165
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,563
-This is my time.
-"This is my time."

166
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:54,683
Since you started med school,
your time is all the time, isn't it?

167
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,683
May I?

168
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,083
-Please.
-Thank you for that, really.

169
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,283
Fucking shit!

170
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,083
Overdraft of 693 euros?

171
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:11,243
Oh, no!

172
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,443
What's that?

173
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:15,963
I was hacked!

174
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,363
No. That's me.

175
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:22,123
That's me.

176
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,243
This wasn't me.

177
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:25,723
It was.

178
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:29,763
No, me.

179
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:35,163
All right, so I spent
5,000 euros in one week.###week:semaine:5.42:[peux, aide]###

180
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:46,163
-The main results…
-Oh, with bricks…###bricks:briques:3.86:[crever, puce]###

181
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,763
-Shush.
-…of stentoplasty

00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:49,363
are in the second table.###table:tableau:4.82:[drôle, désolé]###

183
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,043
When is Manon coming?

184
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,123
I don't know.

185
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,083
-…to compare
-Hey, this is not coffee.

186
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:56,043
-Of course not.
-…to stentoplasty

187
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:58,603
on populations strictly osteoporotic…

188
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:24,603
No significant difference was observed###difference:différence:4.9:[vendredi, putain]###

189
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:28,403
on the analgesic level or in terms
of symptomatic complications.

190
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:33,483
The superiority of stentoplasty
with a height gain…###height:hauteur:4.79:[vendredi, don]###

191
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:35,163

00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,323
…in comparison…

…to vertebroplasty.

194
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:47,123
The most popular in comparison
to kyphoplasty###kyphoplasty:cyphoplastie:0.0:[ostéoporotiques, cyphoplastie]###

00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,963

-Don't even.###table:tableau:4.82:[bonheur, secondes]###

196
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:51,123
-Fine.
-With the correction of kyphosis

197
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:55,003
of 4.2 degrees against 4.5.###degrees:degrés:4.39:[da, comparaison]###

198
00:09:55,563 --> 00:10:00,523
The values are similar
to the ones of other studies###studies:études:5.09:[con, mec]###

199
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,843
-in osteoporotic populations.
-No way?

200
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,723
Phillipe, you think this is the time?

201
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,363
But I don't understand.

202
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:09,763
Sorry, honey.

203
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:10,843
Go on.

204
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:11,923
I'm recording.

205
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,483
The lack of height when…###height:hauteur:4.79:[couleur, génie]###

206
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:19,443
-I don't have a clue.
-Same.

207
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:21,443
Yes.

208
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:23,883
We're good.

209
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:25,963
What's for today?

210
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,683
Attila, can you read for everyone?

211
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:32,283
-Phones in your pockets.
-"The hidden face of apps."###-Phones:téléphones:4.1:[relevé, photographe]###

212
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,403
Right. What does it mean?

213
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:38,643
If it's free, it means you're the product.###product:produit:5.17:[raison, parents]###

214
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:41,283
Anyone?

215
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:46,443
Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon.

216
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:50,363
They all offer their services
in exchange for your…###exchange:échange:4.74:[couleur, concept]###

217
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,403
Personal data.###data:données:5.08:[putain, chercher]###

218
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:55,243
Everything you like, think, share,
they collect everything.

219
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:59,483
Then they sell your data to brands
who target you to buy their stuff.###brands:marques:4.45:[magasin, appareils]###

220
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:02,083
Do you realize what that means?

221
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,883
They know what pictures you look at,

222
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,523
for how long, what you type
in search engines

223
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,803
like YouPorn and whatnot.
Even the texts you send to your mom.

224
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:13,923
Even worse. Your mom's texts.

225
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:17,363
They can access everything.

226
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,003
That data stuff is crazy.###data:données:5.08:[octobre, putain]###

227
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,923
They think we're pigeons.

228
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,603
What can we do?
It's the same for everyone.

229
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,003
Unless we disappear.

230
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,563
If we all disconnect, they can't sell us.

231
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,523
What?

232
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:38,923
I have an idea.###idea:idée:5.38:[crois, retour]###

233
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:41,763
"I will maintain them,

234
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:45,723
and improve them to ensure
the best services I will be asked for."

235
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,603
"I will help my colleagues
and their family in adversity,###family:famille:5.52:[soir, crois]###

236
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:54,003
and the orders...

237
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:56,203
...if I fail."

238
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:11,163
Quit? What do you mean?

239
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:14,603
One day, I decided to quit.###day:jour:5.75:[mort, oui]###

240
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,643
Screens, the Internet.
I swear I'm so woke now.

241
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:19,603
-Really?
-Yes.

242
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,163
Because I…

243
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:26,523
Gagan has been flirting with me
for years, and now I let him in.###years:années:5.63:[mort, ci]###

244
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:27,443
Yes.

245
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:31,403
Happiness was right there.###Happiness:bonheur:4.8:[jambes, rendez-vous]###

246
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:33,563
In front of me.

247
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:35,683
All right. Great.

248
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,243
-Melanie, what's your job?
-I take pictures of vegetables.###vegetables:légumes:4.27:[écrans, congé]###

249
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:41,643
-Here's my work.
-Vegetables?###-Vegetables:légumes:4.27:[auras, ingénieur]###

250
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:43,723
-Incredible.
-This is my favorite.

251
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:46,683
-Awesome.
-Yes.

252
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:48,163
-I love it.
-Really?

253
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:51,083
In my shop, I have organic vegetables.
How funny.###vegetables:légumes:4.27:[billet, champagne]###

254
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,403
-No way?
-I swear.

255
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,643
-So funny. I could take pictures.
-Yes.###pictures:photos:5.1:[hein, carte]###

256
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,803
Totally, I'm up for it.

257
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:58,683
How about tomorrow?###tomorrow:demain:5.14:[études, chance]###

258
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:00,123
Definitely. Tomorrow it is.###Tomorrow:demain:5.14:[courant, regarde]###

259
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:01,483
No?

260
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,803
-Not tomorrow?
-No.###tomorrow:demain:5.14:[salle, services]###

261
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,243
-No, not tomorrow. Busy.
-Too bad.###tomorrow:demain:5.14:[photo, confiance]###

262
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:07,883
-We have to go to…
-The store.

263
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,563
-To get a new couch.
-Okay.###couch:canapé:4.15:[adieu, com]###

264
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:12,323
-Couple's couch.
-Let's congratulate Julien.###couch:canapé:4.15:[cure, challenge]###

265
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,043
-Pleasure.
-All right.

266
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:19,283
It was super nice to meet you,
and Léa, kudos on the dress.###dress:robe:4.59:[jambes, appels]###

267
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,163
It was really bold. Good for you, girl.

268
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,603
See you.

269
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,563
Not so…

270
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:27,723
-What?
-What?

271
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:28,923
-She's not so…
-What?###-She:elle:6.49:[tu, me]###

272
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:30,403
-Come on!
-Okay, she is.

273
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:34,083
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

274
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:37,603
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

-We are not pigeons!

276
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,283
-We are not pigeons!
-Are you Yacine?

277
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,563
That's me.

278
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:48,163
I just wanted to say
I love your idea of detox.###idea:idée:5.38:[femmes, plan]###

279
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:51,563
It's a great idea to show our generation
is not all about that.###generation:génération:4.71:[savez, tableau]###

280
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:52,483
Cool.

281
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:56,523
So, what's the idea? To drop phones
and computers during the break?###phones:téléphone:5.0:[salle, chemin]###

282
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:01,243
Yes, you post a picture of you
on Insta with #werenotpigeons

283
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:02,403
and you turn it off.

284
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:03,523
All right.

285
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,203
See you in 15 days.###days:jours:5.65:[merci, question]###

286
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,003
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

287
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:08,923
Bye.

288
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:12,563
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

289
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,323
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,123
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

291
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:19,483
-We are not pigeons!
-We are not pigeons!

292
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,203
Yes.

293
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,603
Yes. Oh, god.

294
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:29,163
The party is ready.

295
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:31,363
Coming!

296
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:33,923
Hey! Come here.

297
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,963
Hey, where were you?

298
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,403
Do you have 5,000 euros by any chance?

299
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,443
Of course.

300
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,163
-Really?
-Of course not.

301
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:49,483
I'm broke and this close to losing my job.

302
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,163
Why?

303
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:54,203
-A problem?
-No worries. Just a thing with Driko.###problem:problème:5.41:[grand-père, accord]###

304
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,843
-All right. I'm going back.
-Yes.

305
00:14:57,923 --> 00:14:59,723
What's this? I mean, the dress.###dress:robe:4.59:[pote, min]###

306
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:02,523
-It's a dress.
-Sure. And with Guillaume?###dress:robe:4.59:[savez, effort]###

307
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,323
It's great. I think he's jealous.

308
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,043
See you.

309
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:08,803
Right.

310
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:16,043
Daddy is a doctor now. He got his thesis.

311
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,563
Now, he can finally
take his paternity leave.

312
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,803
And mom can go to work.

313
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,643
Don't look.

314
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:27,283
What? No.

315
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:28,963
You did right. Yes.

316
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,283
-It's unbelievable.
-Right.

317
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,003
Exactly, Mr. Principal.

318
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,883
-Count on us.
-He is so grounded.

319
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:38,723
-As soon as he gets home.
-Goodbye.

320
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,283
Go see Aunty Patty.

321
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:44,363
They're all touchy-feely. It's disgusting.

322
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:46,283
Look at them.

323
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,363
Ridiculous.

324
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:49,243
-…a text.
-Look at them.

325
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:51,883
Julien, look at me.

326
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:54,043
-A selfie.
-They're ridiculous.

327
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:56,283
I'm so pissed.

328
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,323
Wait a minute.

329
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,243
-Fine.
-Look at me.

330
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,003
-I think…
-…at ten.

331
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,443
So cute.

332
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,963
-Ouch.
-Sorry.

333
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:10,083
My cutie pie.

334
00:16:10,163 --> 00:16:12,363
I'm sorry. Please, listen.

335
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:14,043
Two minutes, please. Thank you.

336
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:17,323
As you know,
I've been living without screens.###screens:écrans:4.07:[meuf, ordi]###

337
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:21,043
And it completely freed me.
I'm another person now.###person:personne:5.73:[jours, droit]###

338
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:25,363
And tonight, I'm off for an offline
weekend in the countryside.

339
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,283
Fun.

340
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:30,043
And my wish for you
is that you free yourselves too.

341
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,763
Because we're a family,###family:famille:5.52:[idée, exemple]###

342
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:36,363
and we have barely talked to each other
since Julien's fascinating thesis is over.

343
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:39,803
Now, that's enough. We take action
and put our gizmos in the box.

344
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,603
Come on. And no discussion.

345
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:44,443
It's over. Let's be free.

346
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:45,763
Come on!

347
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,523
Little challenge.

348
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,723
Yes, I think it's a good idea.###idea:idée:5.38:[centre, porte]###

349
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:52,483
-Anyone?
-I'll do it.

350
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:54,323
-Here.
-Give your box.

351
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,243
Yes.

352
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:56,243
You do it.

353
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:58,763
-Why?
-Because it's fun.

354
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:01,123
-Well…
-Come on.

355
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,203
-It'll be fun.
-Let's try.

356
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,723
I'm glad.

357
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:06,603
-Here.
-Perfect.

358
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,163
-Here.
-Come on, you two.

359
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,963
-Perfect.
-Good job!

360
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,283
-Great job!
-To make Léa happy.

361
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:14,203
-For once.
-It's not easy.

362
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,362
Smartass.

363
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,723
Great. Dad?

364
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,362
Your timing is not great
because I have chess at 7 p.m.###chess:échecs:4.02:[canapé, gain]###

365
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:23,162
If you want to play,
there are plenty of board games.###games:jeux:5.18:[musique, photo]###

366
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,362
You could play with your grandchildren.###grandchildren:petits-enfants:5.0:[attention, cœur]###

367
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:32,443
Lyna too. It's over.
You're going to feel so free.

368
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:34,163
-Can I get the box?
-Yes!

369
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:39,083
Wait up, Léa. Sorry, I just wanted to say
I think your detox thing is dope.

370
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:44,483
Yes, really. And I know it's not easy,
you probably want to relapse sometimes.

371
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:47,363
I know what I'm talking about.

372
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:50,963
You've been through a digital detox?

373
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,003
Vaginal.

374
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,083
-What?
-I used to be a nymphomaniac.

375
00:17:56,163 --> 00:18:00,483
-I see.
-Now, I'm cured, I've moved on and…

376
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:02,763
And it's cool. But…

377
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,323
Yes, I'm proud of myself.

378
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:10,003
You'll see,
you'll be proud of you too, one day.###day:jour:5.75:[années, lieu]###

379
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,923
Right, I'll stop bothering you.

380
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:13,963
See you.

381
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,043
Yes. I'm coming!

382
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,483
You were here?

383
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,323
-Yes.
-That's awesome. You packed?

384
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,003
-You're ready to leave? Great!
-No. Not at all.

385
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:30,763
I have to tell you.
I can't work at the restaurant.

386
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,123
Why not?

387
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:35,563
As I told you, I'm doing a detox
with Léa for a month.

388
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:40,043
And I can't leave her,
since we promised to support each other.

389
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:42,843
But of course, you're right.

390
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:45,883
That's a lot more important
than your lonely mother.###mother:mère:5.45:[tour, centre]###

391
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,203
Mom, stop it. I'm not abandoning you.

392
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:50,363
A little.

393
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:55,043
Okay, I'll come home. But after my detox.

394
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,163
-All right?
-Promise?

395
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:58,403
Yes.

396
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:00,403
Baby!

397
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:04,163
You coming back is the greatest thing
that could happen to me.

398
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,123
-You know that, right?
-I do.

399
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:07,203
-You do?
-I do.

400
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:08,323
-Really?
-Yes.

401
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:09,323
-Yes.
-You know it.

402
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,683
I need to grab another bottle.

403
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:13,083
Julien's champagne is gross.

404
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:14,643
-I see.
-What a cheapskate!###cheapskate:radin:3.07:[burgers, karaoké]###

405
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:28,923
Okay.

406
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,723
-This is good.
-You forgot this.

407
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:37,043
And this.

408
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:41,723
I can give you 700 euros.

409
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:43,843
What? For all that?

410
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:45,003
I need 5,000.

411
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,083
But you didn't see everything.
This! The fake ass.

412
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:51,323
It's silicon. Touch it.

413
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:55,683
Maybe you can get more on the Internet,
but here, take it or leave it.

414
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:57,043
So?

415
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,043
-I'll leave it.
-Here you go.

416
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:02,283
Good.

417
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:04,283
So…

418
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:06,763
€700.

419
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,563
-Thank you.
-Good day!###day:jour:5.75:[moment, personne]###

420
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:11,083
Mireille told me you used to be a lawyer?

421
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:14,443
Yes. But I quit.

422
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:18,283
When my grandfather died,
I turned his hardware store into a market.###grandfather:grand-père:5.28:[femmes, musique]###

423
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:21,403
-I didn't like my job anymore?
-And do you like middle-aged women?###women:femmes:5.45:[côté, fais]###

424
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:27,363
Very funny joke. I love it.

425
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,123
But I'm going to have to leave you,
Patricia.

426
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:33,643
I have to go, sorry. Here, take this.

427
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:37,243
I love that.

428
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,643
-Want to try?
-…so we can have peace.

429
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:50,243
Guillaume, I… I know
about Melanie and her past.

430
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,283
about Melanie and her past.

431
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:53,843
So…

432
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,803
Just say one word
and I'll cancel everything. Okay?###word:mot:5.22:[crois, tour]###

433
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:58,483
What "everything"?

434
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,683
Everything. I'll dump Gagan.

435
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:02,723
One word and I do it.###word:mot:5.22:[ah, hein]###

436
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,003
-And I'm yours.
-Gagan is the…

437
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,603
The guy fighting with the door to flee?###door:porte:5.47:[heures, question]###

438
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:09,523
Sorry.

439
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,523
Give me two seconds.

440
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,283
Good job!

441
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:22,923
Wait! Please don't leave me!
I'm begging you.

442
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:25,563
-I have a date at 7 P.M.
-I know.

443
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,683
I know, but honestly,
you're too old for that.

444
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:29,163
What are you going to get?

445
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:33,443
A 25-year-old girl without cellulite
who will give you a titjob?

446
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:36,723
-Yes.
-But I can give you a titjob myself!

447
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:38,083
Really?

448
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,563
-Mom!
-No.

449
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:40,963
I am disgusting. Go!

450
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:43,323
-Yes? I told you.
-Please, leave.

451
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,203
Hey everyone, can you do that?

452
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,203
-Hey!
-It wasn't me.

453
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:49,483
Yes!

454
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:51,643
Awesome!

455
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:54,963
Nice!

456
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:58,083
-Melanie!
-Melanie!

457
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:02,523
-Melanie!
-Melanie!

458
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,843
-Melanie!
-Melanie!

459
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:14,603
I can see you, Dad.

460
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,243
How are you?

461
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,043
Fine.

462
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:21,083
What are you doing?

463
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:22,563
Nothing.

464
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:26,323
To hell with it.

465
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:34,803
Think of your detox.

466
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:38,243
Look, I won't tell Mom about the iPad,
but please, leave me alone.

467
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,323
It's simple.

468
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,483
Screensaver, of course.

469
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,083
This bitch's phone…

470
00:22:57,563 --> 00:23:00,283
He's her screensaver too.
Obviously. Of course.

471
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:03,923
They love each other.

472
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,563
So they need to see each other
all the time.

473
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,723
"I love you."

474
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:16,043
Gagan is not really your boyfriend, is he?
You're still in love with Guillaume.

475
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:23,043
It unlocked. That's freaking awesome.

476
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:37,003
Three, two, one,

477
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,323
eat!

478
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,683
Done! I'm done!

479
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:54,603
Done!

480
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:59,363
With 11 hamburgers in 7 min
and 45 seconds,

481
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:01,843
our winner is…###winner:gagnant:4.35:[congé, sortes]###

482
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,643
-Yes!
-What's your name?###name:nom:5.59:[mort, face]###

483
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:04,603
Patricia.

484
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:05,843
Patricia!

485
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:09,683
-Here.
-Thanks.###-Thanks:merci:5.62:[rapport, moment]###

486
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:13,883
Tell me, do you host another contest
before tonight?###contest:concours:4.9:[attention, week]###

487
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:15,243
Why? You need money?

488
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:16,723
Yes.

489
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:19,643
All bets are off.

490
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:22,203
Don't come closer!

491
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:23,843
Beautiful!

492
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:26,003
Come on!

493
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,683
Let's go!

494
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:29,363
Go, beast!

495
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:31,323
Beat them!

496
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,083
-Yes!
-Stupid! Turn around.

497
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:35,323
What the hell?

498
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:37,123
No! Turn around.

499
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:38,323
Turn around!

500
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:40,723
Dammit.

501
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,803
-Yes!
-Yes!

502
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:50,843
Here, take this. And that's it. Got it?

503
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,203
-I have like 150 left.
-Hey.

504
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,043
-Ten is missing. You?
-Hey.

505
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:56,883
-Please.
-Wait, I'm counting my money.

506
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,483
I'm sorry, okay?

507
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,563
But it's life and death. I need money.

508
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:01,803
Really important.

509
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:06,123
It's not my fault if I chose
the wrong bunny. But now I get it.

510
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:08,883
Here's 20 euros.
I know it's going to work.

511
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,683
Doesn't matter. Bunny's cold and sleepy.

512
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:14,443
So now, beat it! And the 10 euros
is my commission from last time.

513
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:16,283
It's my first time.

514
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:20,403
I saw you shoot my rifle at the fest,
so now you shut up and leave.

515
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:22,003
-Go away.
-Bye.

516
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:23,443
Twenty missing.

517
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:25,683
Hi, everyone.

518
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:27,923
Hi, grandma.

519
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:29,763
Hi, honey. How was school?

520
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,483
Yes. It was great.

521
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,083
Really? You had a great day?###day:jour:5.75:[mort, lieu]###

522
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:35,163
Yes.

523
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,843
Good for you.

524
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:38,603
Because your break is going to be…

525
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:41,843
Here, baby.

526
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,323
Thanks.###Thanks:merci:5.62:[cours, fais]###

527
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:44,403
Please, stop.

528
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,603
What kind of break?

529
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,123
-What kind?
-What?

530
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,283
A shitty break. Got it. What did I do?

531
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:53,963
What did you do? I don't know,
your principal called for disturbance.

532
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,323
You're not coming to Mexico with us.

533
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:58,763
-No sun!
-No beach!###beach:plage:4.63:[billet, madame]###

534
00:25:58,843 --> 00:26:01,243
-No surfing!
-What?

535
00:26:01,323 --> 00:26:02,843
You'll think twice next time.

536
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:05,003
I can't stay home for two weeks.

537
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,563
Of course not. It would be too easy.

538
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,563
-You're staying here.
-Detoxing.

539
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:12,363
Okay? With three meals, two phone calls,###calls:appels:4.4:[magasin, thèse]###

540
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:16,083
one shower,
and of course, zero screens per day.###day:jour:5.75:[années, peux]###

541
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:17,003
That's a lot.

542
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:19,763
They're so strict.

543
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:22,723
In your face.

544
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,283
2007, let's go.

545
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:28,643
Wow.

546
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:30,283
Not great.

547
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,843
Yes, take it.

548
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:34,523
Great, jerk!

549
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:35,563
2015.

550
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,523
Come on.

551
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:40,403
What bullcrap.

552
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:44,883
She's a fascist nympho!

553
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:49,003
-What?
-She's a fascist. Look at his torso!

554
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,603
I see a tattoo, but what's the…###tattoo:tatouage:3.86:[ipad, chéri]###

555
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,843
It's a fucking swastika, dad!

556
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:57,443
-Wait up!
-My god!

557
00:26:57,523 --> 00:26:59,443
-I'm going to expose this bitch!
-Léa!

558
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:02,683
Look what I found on Melanie's phone!

559
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:04,563
Léa, why would you do that?

560
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:06,523
You went through my girl's phone?

561
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:08,483
-Are you insane?
-I'm so sorry, Melanie.

562
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,283
-It's okay.
-You're not listening.

563
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:11,563
She's healing.

564
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:13,203
But wait, you haven't seen the picture.###picture:photo:5.14:[classe, adresse]###

565
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:16,203
-Nobody cares.
-You shouldn't trust

566
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,803
-this woman. She has secrets.
-Stop it, Léa.

567
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:21,723
-Go get help!
-I'm sick of it!

568
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:24,483
We're celebrating my thesis,
but nobody cares!

569
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,363
-Not true!
-Yes, it is!

570
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:27,963
You're hysterical.

571
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:30,723
You're stuck on your phone
as if it were a new invention.

572
00:27:30,803 --> 00:27:32,163
And Yacine, hello?

573
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:35,923
Didn't you miss something?
My thesis! Ten years of studying!

574
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:39,683
What about Manon? Where is she?
We don't even know!

575
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:42,043
Anyone care that I'm now a doctor?

576
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,123
-Of course.
-Okay?

577
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,083
It's something! I'm a doctor!
Engineer of living things.

578
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:47,923
This was my day!

579
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,403
My day!

580
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:51,923
Julien…

581
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,403
He still throws tantrums?

582
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,123
-Yes.
-Right?

583
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:56,443
<i>Checkmate.</i>

584
00:27:56,523 --> 00:27:59,443
<i>Phil0355, you lost.</i>

585
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,723
No, I lost.

586
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,763
<i>-Play again?
</i>-I lost.

587
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:25,443
How are you?

588
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,003
-Good and you?
-Got my money?###money:fric:3.99:[mat, angoisse]###

589
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:30,283
-Not yet, but… Ouch!
-I said tonight. Was I not clear?

590
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:31,403
What?

591
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:33,963
I need to get the keys of Bernard's truck.###keys:clés:4.48:[euro, balles]###

592
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,723
Look, that's Manon.

593
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:37,523
-What?
-I'll ruin your face!

594
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:40,163
-The hell?
-I said tonight!

595
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:41,563
-Let her go!
-Let me go!

596
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:43,763
-Let her go!
-Fuck you!

597
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:46,123
-Let her go!
-Take this!

598
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:51,443
-Who's that?
-Bernard.###-Who:qui:6.89:[quoi, oui]###

599
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:53,563
The bar's owner.

600
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:57,603
It sucks that I don't have my phone,
nobody will believe me.

601
00:28:58,443 --> 00:28:59,563
Let's give him boobs.

602
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,323
Yes, big boobs.

603
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:04,763
-A big one and a small one.
-Okay with stretch marks.

604
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,763
What the hell are you doing?

605
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:10,283
Threaten me again
and the shovel goes in your head.###shovel:pelle:3.68:[gagnante, confrères]###

606
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:13,283
Ask for one euro from her
and I bury you alive. Got it?

607
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:14,563
Got it?

608
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:15,843
Yes. I got it.

609
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,803
-Let's go!
-Motherfucker!

610
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:19,563
Thanks, Bernard.###Thanks:merci:5.62:[société, tes]###

611
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:21,803
Just like in a movie.###movie:film:5.36:[chambre, aide]###

612
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:24,003
Bernard is so cray-cray.

613
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:25,803
Manon!

614
00:29:26,443 --> 00:29:27,883
Don't leave me here, dammit!

615
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:29,523
Manon!

616
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:31,643
Don't leave me!

617
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:36,123
-Yes! Bye!
-Help!

618
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:38,683
Yes!

619
00:29:39,163 --> 00:29:40,283
Manon!

620
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:44,643
All day long, like a teenager.
You're ridiculous.

621
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:45,843
That's enough, Mireille!

622
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:50,203
I want to enjoy my passion for screens.
No limits, no arguing. I want to be free!###screens:écrans:4.07:[angoisse, lourde]###

623
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,123
Do you hear yourself?

624
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:54,603
-You're going nuts.
-Go to hell!

625
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,843
I've been an accountant for 42 years!###accountant:comptable:4.02:[lourde, préférée]###

626
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:59,083
Let me do what I want,
the way I want, when I want.

627
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:02,363
And you'd better do the same
rather than nagging all the time.

628
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:03,603
Because I won't stop!

629
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:13,203
Hi, Aunty Patty.

630
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:16,923
Hey! Don't say Aunty Patty, just Patty.

631
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,763
-How are you?
-Good and you?

632
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:22,323
So tell me,
have you already dipped your biscuit?

633
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,323
You're so annoying.

634
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,403
So sensitive!

635
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:29,003
I'm sleeping in the office.###office:bureau:5.04:[services, chercher]###

636
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:33,403
Hey, Manon was with you, right?
Do you know when she's coming home?

637
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:37,243
Okay. That looks creepy.

638
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,083
Is it the right address?###address:adresse:4.94:[tableau, con]###

639
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:46,763
I think so.

640
00:30:56,683 --> 00:31:00,443
I see. It's more on the creepy side
than the paradise side.###paradise:paradis:4.44:[plaît, comparaison]###

641
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,403
Are you sure you want to stay?

642
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:06,563
It's either this, or having my mom
the whole weekend, so this.

643
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:07,923
-Right. Fuck.
-What was that?

644
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:08,923
I don't know.

645
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,603
Holy shit! Be nice.

646
00:31:25,123 --> 00:31:26,243
Nice doggy.

647
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:28,283
Nice doggy, okay?

648
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:29,803
Yes, you're a nice doggy.

649
