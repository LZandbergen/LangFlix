-Oh, God.###math:mathe:4.12###

00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:27,306
-Why didn't you wake me up earlier?
-I was cleaning up!

You don't know my parents!###parents:eltern:5.26###

Hi. We weren't expecting you.

7
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,706
Fritzi, parents. Parents, Fritzi.###parents:eltern:5.26###

8
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,906
-Hi, Gerda. Everything okay?
-Yeah, it's good.

9
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:46,666
We have to go. See you later.

10
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,186
You stay here! Did you forget about
your coaching for college applications?

11
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,706
It sure cost us enough!

12

Yo, Dan! Lisa texted you.

00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,226
Her mother found something.###mother:mutter:5.26###

00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:02,026
Maybe the competition people were right,
the idea's just not good.###idea:idee:5.2###

95
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,386
The back end
is too time consuming for it.

96
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,506
When was the last time
you wrote a line of code?###line:zeile:3.97###

97
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,186
Why is Dan messaging you?

98
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:15,146
And why are you still on Facebook?

99
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,026
Dan's not messaging me.
Dan's messaging Lisa.

100
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,906
So you did log into her account?

101
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,506
You're crazy.

102
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:52,746
Okay. Deleting messages
from my girlfriend's Facebook###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

103
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,386
<i>before she's read them,</i>

104
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,306
<i>not exactly my finest hour.</i>

105
00:07:56,386 --> 00:08:00,546
<i>But do you remember what I said before</i>
<i>about the right timing?</i>

106
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,626
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>The moment I'd been waiting for.</i>

107
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:04,546
Lisa needs help###help:hilfe:5.24###

108
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:09,346
<i>and it would be highly unreasonable</i>
<i>to leave it to this guy.</i>

109
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:12,226
<i>Pull her out of a burning vehicle? Fine.</i>

110
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:15,466
Or save her during a zombie apocalypse?
Why not?###apocalypse:apokalypse:3.57###

111
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:20,506
<i>But not when it comes</i>
<i>to complex family disputes.</i>

112
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:25,426
I was wondering
if you'd ever show up again.

113
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:30,666
Lisa stopped talking about you.
I was worried about you two.

114
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:33,786
Moritz has a lot going on right now.

115
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,706
-Yes. I'm really focused on a new project.
-We're having a cris--###project:projekt:4.97###

116
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:40,426
We're having a crisis discussion
at the moment.###discussion:gespräch:4.8###

117
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,266
But I'm sure you were
at her party, too, right?

118
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,146
-What party?
-We know about the party.

119
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:52,306
-About Lisa's drugs--
-Oh, you knew Lisa takes pills?###pills:pillen:3.62###

120
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:54,466
-Well, I--
-Did you know my mom takes pills?###pills:pillen:3.62###

121
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,146
-That's medicine! I'm sick!
-Your mother has an illness!###illness:krankheit:4.59###

122
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,506
I take pills so I can be myself.

123
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,506
Mom, people take MDMA
so they can be themselves.

124
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,666
You think downing two Tavors with a bottle
of wine every day is any better?###day:tag:5.69###

125
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,786
Well, you can definitely forget
about studying abroad now.

126
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,306
-I'm sure that was in that--
-Jacksonville.

127
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,426
Jacksonville, where you first tried this.

128
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,466
What do you think, Moritz?

129
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,826
She must have
brought the pills back from there.###pills:pillen:3.62###

130
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,146
-There's something I need to clarify.
-Yes?

131
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,466
The pill was mine.###pill:pille:3.84###

132
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:26,826
And where would you have gotten them?

133
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,746
Lisa didn't know I brought them.

134
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:30,786
Moritz, you don't have to lie to us.

135
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:34,666
And I guess you finally found a reason
to keep our daughter from moving out.###daughter:tochter:5.08###

136
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:36,346
Congratulations!###Congratulations:glückwunsch:4.36###

137
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:40,746
It's so easy for you.
You sit there silently, and now--

138
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,346
Now what?

139
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,146
Just because
you're screwing your secretary,

140
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,306
it doesn't mean you can
get out of raising our daughter.###daughter:tochter:5.08###

141
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:04,506
Thank you for taking this break so well.###break:pause:4.63###

142
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,906
You still have my "brain cell"!###cell:zelle:4.14###

143
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,066
Yeah.

144
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:16,986
I even took it to America.

145
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,266
My host family thought
it was a ginger root.###ginger:ingwer:3.37###

146
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,746
Why would anyone have a plush ginger root?###ginger:ingwer:3.37###

147
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,066
No idea.

148
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:34,346
Definitely the most intelligent gift
anyone's ever given me.###gift:geschenk:4.55###

149
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:37,866
Thanks.

150
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,506
You know...

151
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,906
In America,
I was afraid that I'd come back

152
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:49,426
to find everything had changed
and that I'd missed it all.

153
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,986
But it's the exact opposite.

154
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,106
-Nothing changed.
-Yes, but--

155
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,506
It's like time stood still.###time:zeit:5.99###

156
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:11,266
It was really kind of you
to lie for me just now.

157
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,826
But I don't want to stop you
from living your life.###life:leben:5.86###

158
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,826
Maybe something did change.

159
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,626
It really was your ecstasy?

160
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,866
Yes, I got it for you.

161
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:30,546
I was gonna give this to you yesterday
as a welcome gift.###gift:geschenk:4.55###

162
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,906
But then Daniel broke my--

163
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,146
Lisa, it's fine with me
if you want to try new things.

164
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:42,146
Maybe I can help you figure out
what it is you really want.

165
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,266
I think I need to find that out
for myself.

166
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,346
I think it would be better
if you leave now, Moritz.

167
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:18,026
When you make a plan, the probability
that it will fail is about 50 percent.###probability:wahrscheinlichkeit:4.31###

168
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,746
<i>Either it works... or it doesn't.</i>

169
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:22,306
Hey.

170
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:27,386
<i>If you don't make a plan,</i>
<i>the chances of failure are zero percent.</i>

171
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:36,546
{\an8}<i>Life is what happens when</i>
<i>you're making other plans.</i>

172
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,426
<i>It never happens the way you think.</i>

173
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:44,546
<i>Maybe sometimes you should</i>
<i>just stop planning</i>

174
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,266
{\an8}<i>and start doing.</i>

175
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,266
We gamers only level in one direction.###direction:richtung:5.23###

176
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:09,106
<i>Anonymous, dependable,</i>
<i>and guaranteed anonymous.</i>

177
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:10,906
<i>Do you want to know why--?</i>

178
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:14,826
You don't betray your best friend
for your ex-girlfriend.###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

179
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,826
...ex-girlfriend.###girlfriend:freundin:4.99###

180
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,626
How do you sell drugs online?###drugs:drogen:4.55###

181
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:10,826
<i>I suppose most of you have Googled it</i>
<i>by now and discovered</i>

182
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:13,906
<i>that if you do everything right,</i>
<i>it's pretty easy.</i>

183
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,306
The hard part is doing everything right.

184
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:22,226
So if you really Googled that,
you already made the first mistake.

185
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:26,066
Because on the regular Internet,
you leave traces everywhere you go.###traces:spuren:4.5###

186
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:28,826
<i>So it's best to start with the Darknet.</i>

187
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,546
<i>Forget all the horror stories</i>
<i>you've heard about it.</i>

188
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,746
<i>In my generation, everyone has been</i>
<i>to the Darknet at least once.</i>

189
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:40,546
<i>If you have no idea what the Darknet is,</i>
<i>you were probably born before 1990.</i>

190
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,226
Here's someone you like
and who knows all about facts.###facts:fakten:4.49###

191
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:48,706
Hello.

192
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:54,826
My name is Jonathan Frakes,
and I'm going to explain the Darknet.

193
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,306
Did you know that every time
you take a photo,###photo:foto:5.02###

194
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:05,866
your location is stored
in the image file's metadata?###metadata:metadaten:3.18###

195
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:07,746
Maybe you did.

196
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:13,466
Are you also aware that when you buy
a robotic vacuum cleaner like this,

197
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,306
you give the company permission
to take measurements of your home

198
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,906
and sell that data to third parties?###data:daten:5.02###

199
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:20,906
Fucking outrageous.

200
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:26,146
By the way, the company that makes
these vacuum cleaners is called iRobot.

201
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:30,826
Like the Will Smith movie
where robots tried to destroy humanity.###movie:film:5.23###

202
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,426
Think about that.

203
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,386
We live in a world
where big technology companies###technology:technologie:4.32###

204
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,346
know more about us
than we do about ourselves.

205
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,946
It's totally understandable
that some people

206
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:46,586
prefer to remain anonymous
on the Internet.

207
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:52,386
For that, they use a special network
called The Onion Router or just...###network:netzwerk:4.42###

208
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:54,866
"TOR."

209
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,346
<i>If you open a site on the Internet,</i>

210
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,906
the data packet
containing the content###packet:paket:4.39###

211
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:04,786
comes directly from the provider's server.

212
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,626
Totally traceable.

213
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,266
If you open a Darknet address,###address:adresse:4.56###

214
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:13,146
the data packets
are not transferred to you directly.###data:daten:5.02###

215
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:21,426
First, they're routed through
the TOR network from node to node.###node:knoten:4.03###

216
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,426
And each node only has contact
with the previous node

217
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,666
and the next node,
but never the whole chain.###chain:kette:4.26###

218
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:30,346
<i>That means</i>
<i>it's no longer possible to trace</i>

219
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,706
who originally sent the data package.###data:daten:5.02###

220
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:38,106
Are you really sure
that it's Lisa who sent the data?###data:daten:5.02###

221
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,546
Or did we use the Darknet to...

222
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,786
keep you in the dark?

223
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:52,786
Oh, yes, one more thing.

224
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:54,466
Don't do drugs.###drugs:drogen:4.55###

225
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:10,146
One long! One long! Okay, shit. I'm down.

226
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,306
<i>Fuck, it's lagging.</i>

227
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:28,346
The PIN is the date
we had the idea for MyTems.###idea:idee:5.2###

228
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:21,626
Google, read my last message.

229
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:26,266
<i>Hello, Lenny.</i>
<i>You'll think this is really dumb,</i>

230
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:30,066
<i>I get that.</i>
<i>But now you have to listen closely.</i>

231
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,546
<i>Moritz realizes</i>
<i>that he screwed up big-time.</i>

232
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:36,186
He shouldn't have just taken the money.###money:geld:5.59###

233
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,226
<i>He wants to say sorry for that.</i>

234
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:39,426
<i>Apology accepted?</i>

235
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:44,186
-What's wrong with you?
<i>-But then he screwed up again.</i>

236
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:47,106
<i>He took your code</i>
<i>for the MyTems shop system</i>

237
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:51,586
and reprogrammed it to use
as a Darknet drug shop on your server###drug:droge:3.75###

238
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,146
where drugs can be bought anonymously.###drugs:drogen:4.55###

239
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:57,346
<i>He knows that he should have</i>
<i>asked you first.</i>

240
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:58,826
<i>Moritz is an idiot.</i>

241
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:00,586
<i>He was only thinking of Lisa</i>
<i>the whole time,</i>

242
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,986
<i>and he totally forgot about you.</i>

243
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:05,426
<i>Lenny, you are his best friend.</i>

244
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:07,266
End of message.###message:nachricht:4.8###

245
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,466
You turned MyTems into a drug shop?###drug:droge:3.75###

246
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,346
Yes, sorry.

247
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,106
I thought that way
I could pay you the money back.###money:geld:5.59###

248
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:19,106
Let's see it.

249
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:32,146
It's okay, the emails are still
unencrypted here in the database.###database:datenbank:4.11###

250
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:35,226
And for sign-up,
you'd need to embed a new captcha.

251
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,826
But otherwise...

252
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,226
Moritz, not bad!

253
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:42,026
I did some math.

254
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,266
Based on the market price,

255
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:46,746
resellers have a profit margin
of 200 percent.###resellers:reseller:2.77###

256
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:50,506
Apple only makes 65 percent on the iPhone.
It's a business case.

257
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:52,906
It's a business case
that could land us in jail.###jail:gefängnis:4.46###

258
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:56,466
Thanks, Mom.

259
00:21:56,786 --> 00:22:01,506
It's nice seeing you do something
different than always shooting around.

260
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:06,226
Lenny, think about it.

261
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:09,626
This could be our thing--
our ticket out of this dump!

262
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:11,946
If this thing works,
we can do anything we want.

263
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:16,066
Well, then...

264
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:26,786
So, first rule of the shop--###shop--:shop:4.5###

265
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,986
we do not talk about the shop.

266
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,506
That's <i>Fight Club!</i>

267
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:34,946
I've never seen it.

268
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:36,346
Sure, you know it!

269
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:40,186
With the two guys that smack people
in the face the whole time.###time:zeit:5.99###

270
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:43,306
But actually it's just one guy
who's completely crazy.

271
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,106
Sounds great.

272
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:48,706
-Fuck, fuck!
-What's up?

273
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:51,106
I didn't pay the dealer his money.###money:geld:5.59###

274
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:54,026
Fuck it. He's forgotten you by now.

275
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,826
Fuck him, fuck the cops.

276
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:58,826
Now we seed the link
into a few Darknet forums

277
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:00,426
and make some real money, man!

278
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:06,026
Okay. A piece of history
will be written today.###today:heute:5.88###

279
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:17,506
Don't look at me like that.
What could happen?

280
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,946
Well, Daniel.

281
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:27,346
You know you can screw up
your entire future this way, right?

282
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:29,906
I mean,
what other job is there after this?

283
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,426
Postman, bus driver...###driver:fahrer:4.68###

284
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,586
Yeah, so, actually, mainly these two.

285
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:41,946
I'm sure Daddy the national player
and Mommy the bank boss

286
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:46,346
imagined it differently
for their sweet little guy.

287
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,906
It's just four pills.###pills:pillen:3.62###

288
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,386
Small quantity. It's for personal use.###quantity:menge:5.06###

289
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,426
Listen up, Riffert Jr.

290
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,986
You have to read to the end
of the Wikipedia article.###article:artikel:5.24###

Colleague?###Colleague:kollege:4.31###

Baby bird.

293
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:12,066
Now come on, Daniel.
Nobody wants to imprison you here.

325
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:53,546
Fifty grand by the time we graduate.

326
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:55,586
Then we go offline and do everything
we've ever fantasized about.

327
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:56,746
Deal.

328
00:25:56,826 --> 00:26:00,306
But I hope you don't mean
what's in my browser history.###history:verlauf:4.59###

329
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:03,746
By the way...

330
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:07,426
The doctor said
I only have two years left.###years:jahre:5.82###

331
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,426
They said that six years ago.###years:jahre:5.82###

332
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,546
Okay, let's say 100 grand,

333
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,866
otherwise you won't get anything
out of it.

334
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,106
Let's say one million.

335
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,146
Caught you red-handed!

336
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:32,586
Just kidding, boys.

337
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:37,786
You can put your mail right in here.

338
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:41,146
Come on, toss it in.
What's with the gloves?###gloves:handschuhe:3.76###

339
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:46,066
Dermatitis.

340
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:48,066
Yes, me, too.

341
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,786
Yes, it's often caused
by warm air from heating.###heating:heizung:4.01###

342
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:56,026
Or fabric softener. Or stress.

343
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,706
I can tell you something about that.

344
00:26:57,786 --> 00:27:01,346
Now that people can even order
their toilet paper on the Internet,###paper:papier:4.59###

345
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,546
the delivery industry
is totally overstretched.

346
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:08,386
If it goes on like this,
I can hang myself by Christmas.

347
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:13,786
Not that I'm planning to do that,
but it's a hard job sometimes.

348
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:16,026
I earn just over minimum wage,###wage:lohn:4.25###

349
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:18,946
while Amazon's top brass
keep getting richer!

350
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:23,586
Okay, boys.

351
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:26,546
And make sure to always use enough stamps!

352
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:49,626
Yeah, we did.

353
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:58,426
What do we even have now?

354
00:27:58,506 --> 00:27:59,906
Uh, Bio.

355
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,546
Shit, did you do the homework?

356
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,106
No, I wanted to copy Gerda's.

357
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:16,066
PROTECT YOURSELF IN CASE
OF A SHOOTING OR TERROR ATTACK

358
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:18,546
LAST RESORT: DEFEND YOURSELF

359
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:37,786
Mr. Sander?

360
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:42,066
Hello? Do I know you?

361
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:44,226
Congratulations!###Congratulations:glückwunsch:4.36###

362
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:47,346
I mean, reaching sixth place is really,

363
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:50,546
really great.

364
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,306
Thanks. Oops!

365
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:53,666
What?

366
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,066
I didn't wash my hands.###hands:hände:4.77###
